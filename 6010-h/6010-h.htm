    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. &mdash; ELMA&rsquo;S STRANGER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was late when Elma reached the station. Her pony had jibbed on the way
      downhill, and the train was just on the point of moving off as she hurried
      upon the platform. Old Matthews, the stout and chubby-cheeked
      station-master, seized her most unceremoniously by the left arm, and
      bundled her into a carriage. He had known her from a child, so he could
      venture upon such liberties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Second class, miss? Yes, miss. Here y&rsquo;are. Look sharp,
      please. Any more goin&rsquo; on? All right, Tom! Go ahead there!&rdquo;
      And lifting his left hand, he whistled a shrill signal to the guard to
      start her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Elma, somewhat hot in the face with the wild rush for her ticket,
      and grasping her uncounted change, pence and all, in her little gloved
      hand, she found herself thrust, hap-hazard, at the very last moment, into
      the last compartment of the last carriage&mdash;alone&mdash;with an
      artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, you and I, to be sure, most proverbially courteous and intelligent
      reader, might never have guessed at first sight, from the young man&rsquo;s
      outer aspect, the nature of his occupation. The gross and clumsy male
      intellect, which works in accordance with the stupid laws of inductive
      logic, has a queer habit of requiring something or other, in the way of
      definite evidence, before it commits itself offhand to the distinct
      conclusion. But Elma Clifford was a woman; and therefore she knew a more
      excellent way. HER habit was, rather to look things once fairly and
      squarely in the face, and then, with the unerring intuition of her sex, to
      make up her mind about them firmly, at once and for ever. That&rsquo;s one
      of the many glorious advantages of being born a woman. You don&rsquo;t
      need to learn in order to know. You know instinctively. And yet our girls
      want to go to Girton, and train themselves up to be senior wranglers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma Clifford, however, had NOT been to Girton, so, as she stumbled into
      her place, she snatched one hurried look at Cyril Wiring&rsquo;s face, and
      knew at a glance he was a landscape painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, this was clever of her, even in a woman, for Cyril Waring, as he
      fondly imagined, was travelling that line that day disguised as a
      stock-broker. In other words, there was none of the brown velveteen
      affectation about his easy get-up. He was an artist, to be sure, but he
      hadn&rsquo;t assiduously and obtrusively dressed his character. Instead of
      cutting his beard to a Vandyke point, or enduing his body in a Titianesque
      coat, or wearing on his head a slouched Rembrandt hat, stuck carelessly
      just a trifle on one side in artistic disorder, he was habited, for all
      the world like anybody else, in the grey tweed suit of the common British
      tourist, surmounted by the light felt hat (or bowler), to match, of the
      modern English country gentleman. Even the soft silk necktie of a delicate
      aesthetic hue that adorned his open throat didn&rsquo;t proclaim him at
      once a painter by trade. It showed him merely as a man of taste, with a
      decided eye for harmonies of colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when Elma pronounced her fellow-traveller immediately, in her own mind,
      a landscape artist, she was exercising the familiar feminine prerogative
      of jumping, as if by magic, to a correct conclusion. It&rsquo;s a
      provoking way they have, those inscrutable women, which no mere male human
      being can ever conceivably fathom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was just about to drop down, as propriety demands, into the corner
      seat diagonally opposite to&mdash;and therefore as far as possible away
      from&mdash;her handsome companion, when the stranger rose, and, with a
      very flushed face, said, in a hasty, though markedly deferential and
      apologetic tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but&mdash;excuse me for mentioning it&mdash;I
      think you&rsquo;re going to sit down upon&mdash;ur&mdash;pray don&rsquo;t
      be frightened&mdash;a rather large snake of mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so comically alarmed in the ring of his tone&mdash;as
      of a naughty schoolboy detected in a piece of mischief&mdash;that,
      propriety to the contrary notwithstanding, Elma couldn&rsquo;t for the
      life of her repress a smile. She looked down at the seat where the
      stranger pointed, and there, sure enough, coiled up in huge folds, with
      his glossy head in attitude to spring at her, a great banded snake lay
      alert and open-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; Elma cried, drawing back a little in surprise, but
      not at all in horror, as she felt she ought to do. &ldquo;A snake! How
      curious! I hope he&rsquo;s not dangerous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; the young man answered, still in the same
      half-guilty tone of voice as before. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s of a poisonous
      kind, you know; but his fangs have been extracted. He won&rsquo;t do you
      any injury. He&rsquo;s perfectly harmless. Aren&rsquo;t you, Sardanapalus?
      Eh, eh, my beauty? But I oughtn&rsquo;t to have let him loose in the
      carriage, of course,&rdquo; he added, after a short pause. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      calculated to alarm a nervous passenger. Only I thought I was alone, and
      nobody would come in; so I let him out for a bit of a run between the
      stations. It&rsquo;s so dull for him, poor fellow, being shut up in his
      box all the time when he&rsquo;s travelling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma looked down at the beautiful glossy creature with genuine admiration.
      His skin was like enamel; his banded scales shone bright and silvery. She
      didn&rsquo;t know why, but somehow she felt she wasn&rsquo;t in the least
      afraid of him. &ldquo;I suppose one ought to be repelled at once by a
      snake,&rdquo; she said, taking the opposite seat, and keeping her glance
      fixed firmly upon the reptile&rsquo;s eye; &ldquo;but then, this is such a
      handsome one! I can&rsquo;t say why, but I don&rsquo;t feel afraid of him
      at all as I ought, to do. Every right-minded person detests snakes, don&rsquo;t
      they? And yet, how exquisitely flexible and beautiful he is! Oh, pray don&rsquo;t
      put him back in his box for me. He&rsquo;s basking in the sun here. I
      should be sorry to disturb him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril Waring looked at her in considerable surprise. He caught the
      creature in his hands as he spoke, and transferred it at once to a tin
      box, with a perforated lid, that lay beside him. &ldquo;Go back,
      Sardanapalus,&rdquo; he said, in a very musical and pleasant voice,
      forcing the huge beast into the lair with gentle but masterful hands.
      &ldquo;Go back, and go to sleep, sir. It&rsquo;s time for your nap. ... Oh
      no, I couldn&rsquo;t think of letting him out any more in the carriage to
      the annoyance of others. I&rsquo;m ashamed enough as it is of having
      unintentionally alarmed you. But you came in so unexpectedly, you see, I
      hadn&rsquo;t time to put my queer pet away; and, when the door opened, I
      was afraid he might slip out, or get under the seats, so all I could do
      was just to soothe him with my hand, and keep him quiet till the door was
      shut to again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I wasn&rsquo;t at all afraid of him,&rdquo; Elma answered,
      slipping her change into her pocket, and looking prettier through her
      blush than even her usual self. &ldquo;On the contrary, I really liked to
      see him. He&rsquo;s such a glorious snake! The lights and shades on his
      back are so glancing and so wonderful! He&rsquo;s a perfect model. Of
      course, you&rsquo;re painting him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger started. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m painting him&mdash;yes, that&rsquo;s
      true,&rdquo; he replied, with a look of sudden surprise; &ldquo;but why
      &lsquo;of course,&rsquo; please? How on earth could you tell I was an
      artist even?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma glanced back in his face, and wondered to herself, too. Now she came
      to think of it, HOW did she know that handsome young man, with the
      charming features, and the expressive eyes, and the neatly-cut brown
      beard, and the attractive manner, was an artist at all, or anything like
      it? And how did she know the snake was his model? For the life of her, she
      couldn&rsquo;t have answered those questions herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I just guessed it,&rdquo; she answered, after a short
      pause, blushing still more deeply at the sudden way she had thus been
      dragged into conversation with the good-looking stranger. Elma&rsquo;s
      skin was dark&mdash;a clear and creamy olive-brown complexion, such as one
      sometimes sees in southern Europe, though rarely in England; and the
      effect of the blush through it didn&rsquo;t pass unnoticed by Cyril Waring&rsquo;s
      artistic eye. He would have given something for the chance of transferring
      that delicious effect to canvas. The delicate transparency of the blush
      threw up those piercing dark eyes, and reflected lustre even on the glossy
      black hair that fringed her forehead. Not an English type of beauty at
      all, Elma Clifford&rsquo;s, he thought to himself as he eyed her closely:
      rather Spanish or Italian, or say even Hungarian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you guessed right, at any rate,&rdquo; he went on, settling
      down in his seat once more, after boxing his snake, but this time face to
      face with her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working at a beautiful bit of fern and
      foliage&mdash;quite tropical in its way&mdash;in a wood hereabout; and I&rsquo;ve
      introduced Sardanapalus, coiled up in the foreground, just to give life to
      the scene, don&rsquo;t you know, and an excuse for a title. I mean to call
      it &lsquo;The Rajah&rsquo;s Rest.&rsquo; Behind, great ferns and a mossy
      bank; in front, Sardanapalus, after tiffin, rolled spirally round, and
      taking his siesta.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This meeting was a long-wished-for occasion. Elma had never before met a
      real live painter. Now, it was the cherished idea of her youth to see
      something some day of that wonderful non-existent fantastic world which we
      still hope for and dream about and call Bohemia. She longed to move in
      literary and artistic circles. She had fashioned to herself, like many
      other romantic girls, a rose-coloured picture of Bohemian existence; not
      knowing indeed that Bohemia is now, alas! an extinct province, since
      Belgravia and Kensington swallowed it bodily down, digested, and
      assimilated it. So this casual talk with the handsome young artist in the
      second-class carriage, on the Great Southern line, was to Elma as a
      charming and delightful glimpse of an enchanted region she could never
      enter. It was Paradise to the Peri. She turned the conversation at once,
      therefore, with resolute intent upon art and artists, determined to make
      the most while it lasted of this unique opportunity. And since the subject
      of self, with an attentive listener, is always an attractive one, even to
      modest young men like Cyril Waring&mdash;especially when it&rsquo;s a
      pretty girl who encourages you to dilate upon it&mdash;why, the
      consequence was, that before many minutes were over, the handsome young
      man was discoursing from his full heart to a sympathetic soul about his
      chosen art, its hopes and its ideals, accompanied, by a running fire of
      thumb-nail illustrations. He had even got so far in the course of their
      intimacy as to take out the portfolio, which lay hidden under the seat&mdash;out
      of deference to his disguise as a stock-broker, no doubt&mdash;and to
      display before Elma&rsquo;s delighted eyes, with many explanatory comments
      as to light and shade, or perspective and foreshortening, the studies for
      the picture he had just then engaged upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by, as his enthusiasm warmed under Elma&rsquo;s encouragement, the
      young artist produced Sardanapalus himself once more from his box, and
      with deftly persuasive fingers coiled him gracefully round on the opposite
      seat into the precise attitude he was expected to take up when he sat for
      his portrait in the mossy foreground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma couldn&rsquo;t say why, but that creature fascinated her. The longer
      she looked at him the more intensely he interested her. Not that she was
      one bit afraid of him, as she might reasonably have expected to be,
      according to all womanly precedent. On the contrary, she felt an
      overwhelming desire to take him up in her own hands and stroke and fondle
      him. He was so lithe and beautiful; his scales so glistened! At last she
      stretched out one dainty gloved hand to pet the spotted neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; the painter cried, in a warning voice; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      be frightened if he springs at you. He&rsquo;s vicious at times. But his
      fangs are drawn; he can&rsquo;t possibly hurt you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The warning, however, was quite unnecessary. Sardanapalus, instead of
      springing, seemed to recognise a friend. He darted out his forked tongue
      in rapid vibration, and licked her neat grey glove respectfully. Then,
      lifting his flattened head with serpentine deliberation, he coiled his
      great folds slowly, slowly, with sinuous curves, round the girl&rsquo;s
      soft arm till he reached her neck in long, winding convolutions. There he
      held up his face, and trilled his swift, sibilant tongue once more with
      evident pleasure. He knew his place. He was perfectly at home at once with
      the pretty, olive-skinned lady. His master looked on in profound surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re a perfect snake-charmer,&rdquo; he cried at last,
      regarding her with open eyes of wonder. &ldquo;I never saw Sardanapalus
      behave like that with a stranger before. He&rsquo;s generally by no means
      fond of new acquaintances. You must be used to snakes. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve
      kept one? You&rsquo;re accustomed of old to their ways and manners?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; Elma cried, laughing in spite of herself, a
      clear little laugh of feminine triumph; for she had made a conquest, she
      saw, of Sardanapalus; &ldquo;I never so much as touched one in all my life
      before. And I thought I should hate them. But this one seems quite tame
      and tractable. I&rsquo;m not in the least afraid of him. He is so soft and
      smooth, and his movements are all so perfectly gentle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the way with snakes, always,&rdquo; Cyril Waring
      put in, with an admiring glance at the pretty, fearless brunette and her
      strange companion. &ldquo;They know at once whether people like them or
      not, and they govern themselves accordingly. I suppose it&rsquo;s
      instinct. When they see you&rsquo;re afraid of them, they spring and hiss;
      but when they see you take to them by nature, they make themselves
      perfectly at home in a moment. They don&rsquo;t wait to be asked. They&rsquo;ve
      no false modesty. Well, then, you see,&rdquo; he went on, drawing
      imaginary lines with his ticket on the sketch he was holding up, &ldquo;I
      shall work in Sardanapalus just there, like that, coiled round in a spire.
      You catch the idea, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Elma&rsquo;s eye, following his hand while it moved, chanced
      to fall suddenly on the name of the station printed on the ticket with
      which he was pointing. She gave a sharp little start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warnworth!&rdquo; she cried, flushing up, with some slight
      embarrassment in her voice; &ldquo;why, that&rsquo;s ever so far back. We&rsquo;re
      long past Warnworth. We ran by it three or four stations behind; in fact,
      it&rsquo;s the next place to Chetwood, where I got in at.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril Waring looked up with a half-guilty smile as embarrassed as her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I knew that quite well. I&rsquo;m
      down here often. It&rsquo;s half-way between Chetwood and Warnworth I&rsquo;m
      painting. But I thought&mdash;well, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me saying it, I
      thought I was so comfortable and so happy where I was, that I might just
      as well go on a station or two more, and then pay the difference, and take
      the next train back to Warnworth. You see,&rdquo; he added, after a pause,
      with a still more apologetic and penitent air, &ldquo;I saw you were so
      interested in&mdash;well, in snakes, you know, and pictures.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentle as he was, and courteous, and perfectly frank with her, Elma,
      nevertheless, felt really half inclined to be angry at this queer avowal.
      That is to say, at least, she knew it was her bounden duty, as an English
      lady, to seem so; and she seemed so accordingly with most Britannic
      severity. She drew herself up in a very stiff style, and stared fixedly at
      him, while she began slowly and steadily to uncoil Sardanapalus from her
      imprisoned arm with profound dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I should have brought you so far out of your way,&rdquo;
      she said, in a studied cold voice&mdash;though that was quite untrue, for,
      as a matter of fact, she had enjoyed their talk together immensely.
      &ldquo;And besides, you&rsquo;ve been wasting your valuable time when you
      ought to have been painting. You&rsquo;ll hardly get any work done now at
      all this morning. I must ask you to get out at the very next station.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man bowed with a crestfallen air. &ldquo;No time could possibly
      be wasted,&rdquo; he began, with native politeness, &ldquo;that was spent&mdash;&rdquo;
      Then he broke off quite suddenly. &ldquo;I shall certainly get out
      wherever you wish,&rdquo; he went on, more slowly, in an altered voice;
      &ldquo;and I sincerely regret if I&rsquo;ve unwittingly done anything to
      annoy you in any way. The fact is, the talk carried me away. It was art
      that misled me. I didn&rsquo;t mean, I&rsquo;m sure, to obtrude myself
      upon you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And even as he spoke they whisked, unawares, into the darkness of a
      tunnel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. &mdash; TWO&rsquo;S COMPANY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elma was just engaged in debating with herself internally how a young lady
      of perfect manners and impeccable breeding, travelling without a chaperon,
      ought to behave under such trying circumstances, after having allowed
      herself to be drawn unawares into familiar conversation with a most
      attractive young artist, when all of a sudden a rapid jerk of the carriage
      succeeded in extricating her perforce, and against her will, from this
      awkward dilemma. Something sharp pulled up their train unexpectedly. She
      was aware of a loud noise and a crash in front, almost instantaneously
      followed by a thrilling jar&mdash;a low dull thud&mdash;a sound of broken
      glass&mdash;a quick blank stoppage. Next instant she found herself flung
      wildly forward into her neighbour&rsquo;s arms, while the artist, for his
      part, with outstretched hands, was vainly endeavouring to break the force
      of the fall for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      All she knew for the first few minutes was merely that there had been an
      accident to the train, and they were standing still now in the darkness of
      the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some seconds she paused, and gasped hard for breath, and tried in vain
      to recall her scattered senses. Then slowly she sank back on the seat once
      more, vaguely conscious that something terrible had happened to the train,
      but that neither she nor her companion were seriously injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sank back in her place, Cyril Waring bent forward towards her with
      sympathetic kindliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not hurt, I hope,&rdquo; he said, holding out one hand
      to help her rise. &ldquo;Stand up for a minute, and see if you&rsquo;re
      anything worse than severely shaken. No? That&rsquo;s right, then! That&rsquo;s
      well, as far as it goes. But I&rsquo;m afraid the nervous shock must have
      been very rough on you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma stood tip, with tears gathering fast in her eyes. She&rsquo;d have
      given the world to be able to cry now, for the jar had half stunned her
      and shaken her brain; but before the artist&rsquo;s face she was ashamed
      to give free play to her feelings. So she only answered, in a careless
      sort of tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing much, I think. My head feels rather queer;
      but I&rsquo;ve no bones broken. A collision, I suppose. Oughtn&rsquo;t we
      to get out at once and see what&rsquo;s happened to the other people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril Waring moved hastily to the door, and, letting down the window,
      tried with a violent effort to turn the handle from the outside. But the
      door wouldn&rsquo;t open. As often happens in such accidents, the jar had
      jammed it. He tried the other side, and with some difficulty at last
      succeeded in forcing it open. Then he descended cautiously on to the
      six-foot-way, and held out his hand to help Elma from the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no collision, he saw at once, but a far more curious and unusual
      accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking ahead through the tunnel, all was black as night. A dense wall of
      earth seemed to block and fill in the whole space in front of them. Part
      of one broken and shattered carriage lay tossed about in wild confusion on
      the ground close by. Their own had escaped. All the rest was darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment, Cyril rightly divined what must have happened to the train.
      The roof of the tunnel had caved in on top of it. At least one carriage&mdash;the
      one immediately in front of them&mdash;had been crushed and shattered by
      the force of its fall. Their own was the last, and it had been saved as if
      by a miracle. It lay just outside the scene of the subsidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thought rose instinctively at once in the young man&rsquo;s mind. They
      must first see if any one was injured in the other compartments, or among
      the débris of the broken carriage; and then they must make for the open
      mouth of the tunnel, through which the light of day still gleamed bright
      behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He peered in hastily at the other three windows. Not a soul in any one of
      the remaining compartments! It was a very empty train, he had noticed
      himself, when he had got in at Tilgate; the one solitary occupant of the
      front compartment of their carriage, a fat old lady with a big black bag,
      had bundled out at Chetwood. They were alone in the tunnel&mdash;at this
      end of the train at least; their sole duty now was to make haste and save
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed overhead. The tunnel was bricked in with an arch on top. The way
      through in front was blocked, of course, by the fallen mass of
      water-logged sandstone. He glanced back towards the open mouth. A curious
      circumstance, half-way down to the opening, attracted at once his keen and
      practised eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, the roof at one spot was not a true arc of a circle. It
      bulged slightly downwards, in a flattened arch, as if some superincumbent
      weight were pressing hard upon it. Great heavens, what was this? Another
      trouble in store! He looked again, still more earnestly, and started with
      horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the twinkling of an eye, his reason told him, beyond the shadow of a
      doubt, what was happening at the bulge. A second fall was just about to
      take place close by them. Clearly there were TWO weak points m the roof of
      the tunnel. One had already given way in front; the other was on the very
      eve of giving way behind them. If it fell, they were imprisoned between
      two impassable walls of sand and earth. Without one instant&rsquo;s delay,
      he turned and seized his companion&rsquo;s hand hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! quick!&rdquo; he cried, in a voice of eager warning. &ldquo;Run,
      run for your life to the mouth of the tunnel! Here, come! You&rsquo;ve
      only just time! It&rsquo;s going, it&rsquo;s going!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Elma&rsquo;s feminine instinct worked quicker and truer than even
      Cyril Waring&rsquo;s manly reason. She didn&rsquo;t know why; she couldn&rsquo;t
      say how; but in that one indivisible moment of time she had taken in and
      grasped to the full all the varying terrors of the situation. Instead of
      running, however, she held back her companion with a nervous force she
      could never before have imagined herself capable of exerting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop here,&rdquo; she cried authoritatively, wrenching his arm in
      her haste. &ldquo;If you go you&rsquo;ll be killed. There&rsquo;s no time
      to run past. It&rsquo;ll be down before you&rsquo;re there. See, see, it&rsquo;s
      falling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before the words were well out of her mouth, another great crash
      shook the ground behind them. With a deafening roar, the tunnel gave way
      in a second place beyond. Dust and sand filled the air confusedly. For a
      minute or two all was noise and smoke and darkness. What exactly had
      happened neither of them could see. But now the mouth of the tunnel was
      blocked at either end alike, and no daylight was visible. So far as Cyril
      could judge, they two stood alone, in the dark and gloom, as in a narrow
      cell, shut in with their carriage between two solid walls of fallen earth
      and crumbling sandstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this fresh misfortune, Elma sat down on the footboard with her face in
      her hands, and began to sob bitterly. The artist leaned over her and let
      her cry for a while in quiet despair. The poor girl&rsquo;s nerves, it was
      clear, were now wholly unstrung. She was brave, as women go, undoubtedly
      brave; but the shock and the terror of such a position as this were more
      than enough to terrify the bravest. At last Cyril ventured on a single
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lucky,&rdquo; he said, in an undertone, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      get out at Warnworth after all. It would have been dreadful if you&rsquo;d
      been left all alone in this position.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma glanced up at him with a sudden rush of gratitude. By the dim light
      of the oil lamp that still flickered feebly in the carriage overhead, she
      could see his face; and she knew by the look in those truthful eyes that
      he really meant it. He really meant he was glad he&rsquo;d come on and
      exposed himself to this risk, which he might otherwise have avoided,
      because he would be sorry to think a helpless woman should be left alone
      by herself in the dark to face it. And, frightened as she was, she was
      glad of it too. To be alone would be awful. This was pre-eminently one of
      those many positions in life in which a woman prefers to have a man beside
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet most men, she knew, would have thought to themselves at once,
      &ldquo;What a fool I was to come on beyond my proper station, and let
      myself in for this beastly scrape, just because I&rsquo;d go a few miles
      further with a pretty girl I never saw in my life before, and will
      probably never see in my life again, if I once get well out of this
      precious predicament.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But that they would ever get out of it at all seemed to both of them now
      in the highest degree improbable. Cyril, by reason, Elma, by instinct,
      argued out the whole situation at once, and correctly. There had been much
      rain lately. The sandstone was water-logged. It had caved in bodily,
      before them and behind them. A little isthmus of archway still held out in
      isolation just above their heads. At any moment that isthmus might give
      way too, and, falling on their carriage, might crush them beneath its
      weight. Their lives depended upon the continued resisting power of some
      fifteen yards or so of dislocated masonry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appalled at the thought, Cyril moved from his place for a minute, and went
      forward to examine the fallen block in front. Then he paced his way back
      with groping steps to the equally ruinous mass behind them. Elma&rsquo;s
      eyes, growing gradually accustomed to the darkness and the faint glimmer
      of the oil lamps, followed his action with vague and tearful interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the roof doesn&rsquo;t give way,&rdquo; he said calmly at last,
      when he returned once more to her, &ldquo;and if we can only let them know
      we&rsquo;re alive in the tunnel, they may possibly dig us out before we
      choke. There&rsquo;s air enough here for eighteen hours for us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke very quietly and reassuringly, as if being shut up in a fallen
      tunnel between two masses of earth were a matter that needn&rsquo;t cause
      one the slightest uneasiness; but his words suggested to Elma&rsquo;s mind
      a fresh and hitherto unthought-of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen hours,&rdquo; she cried, horror-struck. &ldquo;Do you mean
      to say we may have to stop here, all alone, for eighteen hours together?
      Oh, how very dreadful! How long! How frightening! And if they don&rsquo;t
      dig us out before eighteen hours are over, do you mean to say we shall die
      of choking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril gazed down at her with a very regretful and sympathetic face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to frighten you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;at
      least, not more than you&rsquo;re frightened already; but, of course,
      there&rsquo;s only a certain amount of oxygen in the space that&rsquo;s
      left us; and as we&rsquo;re using it up at every breath, it&rsquo;ll
      naturally hold out for a limited time only. It can&rsquo;t be much more
      than eighteen hours. Still, I don&rsquo;t doubt they&rsquo;ll begin
      digging us out at once; and if they dig through fast, they may yet be in
      time, even so, to save us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma bent forward with her face in her hands again, and, rocking herself
      to and fro in an agony of despair, gave herself vip to a paroxysm of utter
      misery. This was too, too terrible. To think of eighteen hours in that
      gloom and suspense; and then to die at last, gasping hard for breath, in
      the poisonous air of that pestilential tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly an hour she sat there, broken down and speechless; while Cyril
      Waring, taking a seat in silence by her side, tried at first with mute
      sympathy to comfort and console her. Then he turned to examine the roof,
      and the block at either end, to see if perchance any hope remained of
      opening by main force an exit anywhere. He even began by removing a little
      of the sand at the side of the line with a piece of shattered board from
      the broken carriage in front; but that was clearly no use. More sand
      tumbled in as fast as he removed it. He saw there was nothing left for it
      but patience or despair. And of the two, his own temperament dictated
      rather patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned at last, wearied out, to Elma&rsquo;s side. Elma, still
      sitting disconsolate on the footboard, rocking herself up and down, and
      moaning low and piteously, looked up as he came with a mute glance of
      inquiry. She was very pretty. That struck him even now. It made his heart
      bleed to think she should be so cowed and terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to bother you,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, half
      afraid to speak, &ldquo;but there are four lamps all burning hard in these
      four compartments, and using up the air we may need by-and-by for our own
      breathing. If I were to climb to the top of the carriage&mdash;which I can
      easily do&mdash;I could put them all out, and economize our oxygen. It
      would leave us in the dark, but it&rsquo;d give us one more chance of
      life. Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;d better get up and turn them off, or
      squash them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma clasped her hands in horror at the bare suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, no!&rdquo; she cried hastily. &ldquo;Please, PLEASE don&rsquo;t
      do that. It&rsquo;s bad enough to choke slowly, like this, in the gloom.
      But to die in the dark&mdash;that would be ten times more terrible. Why,
      it&rsquo;s a perfect Black Hole of Calcutta, even now. If you were to turn
      out the lights I could never stand it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril gave a respectful little nod of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he answered, as calm as ever. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      just as you will. I only meant to suggest it to you. My one wish is to do
      the best I can for you. Perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;and he hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps
      I&rsquo;d better let it go on for an hour or two more, and then, whenever
      the air begins to get very oppressive&mdash;I mean when one begins to feel
      it&rsquo;s really failing us&mdash;one person, you know, could live on so
      much longer than two... it would be a pity not to let you stand every
      chance. Perhaps I might&mdash;-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma gazed at him aghast in the utmost horror. She knew what he meant at
      once. She didn&rsquo;t even need that he should finish his sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she said, firmly clenching her small hand hard.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so wrong of you to think of it, even. I could never
      permit it. It&rsquo;s your duty to keep yourself alive at all hazards as
      long as ever you can. You should remember your mother, your sisters, your
      family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; Cyril answered, a little
      crestfallen, and feeling he had done quite a wicked thing in venturing to
      suggest that his companion should have every chance for her own life.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no mother, you see, no sisters, no family. Nobody on
      earth would ever be one penny the worse if <i>I</i> were to die, except my
      twin brother; he&rsquo;s the only relation I ever had in my life; and even
      HE, I dare say, would very soon get over it. Whereas YOU&rdquo;&mdash;he
      paused and glanced at her compassionately&mdash;&ldquo;there are probably
      many to whom the loss would be a very serious one. If I could do anything
      to save you&mdash;-&rdquo; He broke off suddenly, for Elma looked up at
      him once more with a little burst of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you talk like that,&rdquo; she cried, with a familiarity that
      comes of association in a very great danger, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
      what I shall do; I don&rsquo;t know what I shall say to you. Why, I couldn&rsquo;t
      bear to be left alone here to die by myself. If only for MY sake, now we&rsquo;re
      boxed up here together, I think you ought to wait and do the best you can
      for yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Cyril answered once more, in a most obedient
      tone. &ldquo;If you wish me to live to keep you company in the tunnel, I&rsquo;ll
      live while I may. You have only to say what you wish. I&rsquo;m here to
      wait upon you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In any other circumstances, such a phrase would have been a mere piece of
      conversational politeness. At that critical moment, Elma knew it for just
      what it was&mdash;a simple expression of his real feeling.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. &mdash; CYRIL WARING&rsquo;S BROTHER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was nine o&rsquo;clock that self-same night, and two men sat together
      in a comfortable sitting-room under the gabled roofs of Staple Inn,
      Holborn. It was as cosy a nook as any to be found within the four-mile
      radius, and artistic withal in its furniture and decorations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the biggest arm-chair by the empty grate, a young man with a flute
      paused for a moment, irresolute. He was a handsome young man, expressive
      eyes, and a neatly-cut brown beard&mdash;for all the world like Cyril
      Waring&rsquo;s. Indeed, if Elma Clifford could that moment have been
      transported from her gloomy prison in the Lavington tunnel to that cosy
      room at Staple Inn, Holborn, she would have started with surprise to find
      the young man who sat in the arm-chair was to all outer appearance the
      self-same person as the painter she had just left at the scene of the
      accident. For the two Warings were truly &ldquo;as like as two peas&rdquo;;
      a photograph of one might almost have done duty for the photograph of the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other occupant of the room, who leaned carelessly against the
      mantelshelf, was taller and older; though he, too, was handsome, but with
      the somewhat cynical and unprepossessing handsomeness of a man of the
      world. His forehead was high; his lips were thin; his nose inclined toward
      the Roman pattern; his black moustache was carefully curled and twisted at
      the extremities. Moreover, he was musical; for he held in one hand the bow
      of a violin, having just laid down the instrument itself on the sofa after
      a plaintive duet with Guy Waring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen this evening&rsquo;s paper, by the way, Guy?&rdquo; he asked,
      after a pause, in a voice that was all honeyed charm and seductiveness.
      &ldquo;I brought the St. James&rsquo;s Gazette for you, but forgot to give
      you it; I was so full of this new piece of mine. Been an accident this
      morning, I see, on the Great Southern line. Somewhere down Cyril&rsquo;s
      way, too; he&rsquo;s painting near Chetwood; wonder whether he could
      possibly, by any chance, have been in it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew the paper carelessly from his pocket as he spoke, and handed it
      with a graceful air of inborn courtesy to his younger companion.
      Everything that Montague Nevitt did, indeed, was naturally graceful and
      courteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy Waring took the printed sheet from his hands without attaching much
      importance to his words, and glanced over it lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock this morning,&rdquo; the telegram said,
      &ldquo;a singular catastrophe occurred in a portion of the Lavington
      tunnel on the Great Southern Railway. As the 9.15 way-train from Tilgate
      Junction to Guildford was passing through, a segment of the roof of the
      tunnel collapsed, under pressure of the dislocated rock on top, and bore
      down with enormous weight upon the carriages beneath it. The engine,
      tender, and four front waggons escaped unhurt; but the two hindmost, it is
      feared, were crushed by the falling mass of earth. It is not yet known how
      many passengers, if any, may have been occupying the wrecked compartments;
      but every effort is now being made to dig out the débris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy read the paragraph through unmoved, to the outer eye, though with a
      whitening face, and then took up the dog-eared &ldquo;Bradshaw&rdquo; that
      lay close by upon the little oak writing-table. His hand trembled. One
      glance at the map, however, set his mind at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Cyril wouldn&rsquo;t
      be there. It&rsquo;s beyond his beat. Lavington&rsquo;s the fourth station
      this way on the up-line from Chetwood. Cyril&rsquo;s stopping at Tilgate
      town, you know&mdash;I heard from him on Saturday&mdash;and the bit he&rsquo;s
      now working at&rsquo;s in Chetwood Forest. He couldn&rsquo;t get lodgings
      at Chetwood itself, so he&rsquo;s put up for the present at the White
      Lion, at Tilgate, and runs over by train every day to Warnworth. It&rsquo;s
      three stations away&mdash;four off Lavington. He&rsquo;d have been daubing
      for an hour in the wood by that time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t attach any great importance to it myself,&rdquo;
      Nevitt went on, unconcerned. &ldquo;I thought most likely Cyril wouldn&rsquo;t
      be there. But still I felt you&rsquo;d like, at any rate, to know about
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; Guy answered, still scanning the map in
      &ldquo;Bradshaw&rdquo; close. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have been there;
      but one likes to know. I think, indeed, to make sure, I&rsquo;ll telegraph
      to Tilgate. Naturally, when a man&rsquo;s got only one relation in the
      whole wide world&mdash;without being a sentimentalist&mdash;that one
      relation means a good deal in life to him. And Cyril and I are more to one
      another, of course, than most ordinary brothers.&rdquo; He bit his thumb.
      &ldquo;Still, I can&rsquo;t imagine how he could possibly be there,&rdquo;
      he went on, glancing at &ldquo;Bradshaw&rdquo; once more. &ldquo;You see,
      if he went to work, he&rsquo;d have got out at Warnworth; and if he meant
      to come to town to consult his dentist, he&rsquo;d have taken the 9.30
      express straight through from Tilgate, which gets up to London twenty-five
      minutes earlier.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but why to consult his dentist in particular?&rdquo; Nevitt
      asked with a smile. He had very white teeth, and he smiled accordingly
      perhaps a little oftener than was quite inevitable. &ldquo;You Warings are
      so absolute. I never knew any such fellows in my life as you are. You
      decide things so beforehand. Why mightn&rsquo;t he have been coming up to
      town, for example, to see a friend, or get himself fresh colours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I said &lsquo;to consult his dentist,&rsquo;&rdquo; Guy
      answered, in the most matter-of-fact voice on earth, suppressing a tremor,
      &ldquo;because you know I&rsquo;ve had toothache off and on myself, one
      day with another, for the whole last fortnight. And it&rsquo;s a tooth
      that never ached with either of us before-this one, you see&rdquo;&mdash;he
      lifted his lip with his forefinger&mdash;&ldquo;the second on the left
      after the one we&rsquo;ve lost. If Cyril was coming up to town at all, I&rsquo;m
      pretty sure it&rsquo;d be his tooth he was coming up to see about. I went
      to Eskell about mine myself last Wednesday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder man seated himself and leaned back in his chair, with his violin
      in his lap; then he surveyed his friend long and curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be awfully odd, Guy,&rdquo; he said at last, after a good
      hard stare, &ldquo;to lead such a queer sort of duplicate life as Cyril
      and you do! Just fancy being the counterfoil to some other man&rsquo;s
      cheque! Just fancy being bound to do, and think, and speak, and wish as he
      does! Just fancy having to get a toothache, in the very same tooth and on
      the very same day! Just fancy having to consult the identical dentist that
      he consults simultaneously! It&rsquo;d drive ME mad. Why, it&rsquo;s clean
      rideeklous!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy Waring looked up hastily from the telegraph form he was already
      filling in, and answered, with some warmth&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; not quite so. It isn&rsquo;t like that. You mistake the
      situation. We&rsquo;re both cheques equally, and neither is a counterfoil.
      Cyril and I depend for our characters, as everybody else does, upon our
      father and mother and our remoter progenitors. Only being twins, and twins
      cast in very much the same sort of mould, we&rsquo;re naturally the
      product of the same two parents, at the same precise point in their joint
      life history; and therefore we&rsquo;re practically all but identical.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rose from his desk, with the telegram in his hand, the porter
      appeared at the door with letters. Guy seized them at once, with some
      little impatience. The first was from Cyril. He tore it open in haste, and
      skimmed it through rapidly. Montague Nevitt meanwhile sat languid in his
      chair, striking a pensive note now and again on his violin, with his eyes
      half closed and his lips parted. Guy drew a sigh of relief as he skimmed
      his note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I expected,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Cyril couldn&rsquo;t
      have been there. He writes last night&mdash;the letter&rsquo;s marked
      &lsquo;Delayed in transmission&rsquo;; no doubt by the accident&mdash;&lsquo;I
      shall come up to town on Friday or Saturday morning to see the dentist.
      One of my teeth is troublesome; I suppose you&rsquo;ve had the same; the
      second on the left from the one we&rsquo;ve lost; been aching a fortnight.
      I want it stopped. But to-morrow I really CAN&rsquo;T leave work. I&rsquo;ve
      got well into the swing of such a lovely bit of fern, with Sardanapalus
      just gleaming like gold in the foreground.&rsquo; So that settles matters
      somewhat. He can&rsquo;t have been there. Though, I think, even so, I&rsquo;ll
      just telegraph for safety&rsquo;s sake and make things certain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt struck a chord twice with a sweep of his hand, listened to it
      dreamily for a minute with far-away eyes, and then remarked once more,
      without even looking up, &ldquo;The same tooth lost, he says? You both had
      it drawn! And now another one aches in both of you alike! How very
      remarkable! How very, very curious!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that WAS queer,&rdquo; Guy replied, relaxing into a smile,
      &ldquo;queer even for us; I won&rsquo;t deny it; for it happened this way.
      I was over in Brussels at the time, as correspondent for the Sphere at the
      International Workmen&rsquo;s Congress, and Cyril was away by himself just
      then on his holiday in the Orkneys. We both got toothache in the self-same
      tooth on the self-same night; and we both lay awake for hours in misery.
      Early in the morning we each of us got up&mdash;five hundred miles away
      from one another, remember&mdash;and as soon as we were dressed <i>I</i>
      went into a dentist&rsquo;s in the Montagne de la Cour, and Cyril to a
      local doctor&rsquo;s at Larwick; and we each of us had it out, instanter.
      The dentists both declared they could save them if we wished; but we each
      preferred the loss of a tooth to another such night of abject misery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt stroked his moustache with a reflective air. This was almost
      miraculous. &ldquo;Well, I should think,&rdquo; he said at last, after
      close reflection, &ldquo;where such sympathy as that exists between two
      brothers, if Cyril had really been hurt in this accident, you must surely
      in some way have been dimly conscious of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy Waring, standing there, telegram in hand, looked down at his companion
      with a somewhat contemptuous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, no,&rdquo; he answered, with common-sense confidence; for
      he loved not mysteries. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe any nonsense of
      that sort, do you? There&rsquo;s nothing in the least mystical in the kind
      of sympathy that exists between Cyril and myself. It&rsquo;s all purely
      physical. We&rsquo;re very like one another. But that&rsquo;s all. There&rsquo;s
      none of the Corsican Brothers sort of hocus-pocus about us in any way. The
      whole thing is a simple caste of natural causation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t believe in brain-waves?&rdquo; Nevitt
      suggested, with a gracefully appropriate undulation of his small white
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy laughed incredulously. &ldquo;All rubbish, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he
      answered, &ldquo;all utter rubbish. If any man knows, it&rsquo;s myself
      and Cyril. We&rsquo;re as near one another as any two men on earth could
      possibly be; but when we want to communicate our ideas, each to each, we
      have to speak or write, just like the rest of you. Every man is like a
      clock wound up to strike certain hours. Accidents may happen, events may
      intervene, the clock may get smashed, and all may be prevented. But, bar
      accidents, it&rsquo;ll strike all right, under ordinary circumstances,
      when the hour arrives for it. Well, Cyril and I, as I always say, are like
      two clocks wound up at the same time to strike together, and we strike
      with very unusual regularity. But that&rsquo;s the whole mystery. If <i>I</i>
      get smashed by accident, there&rsquo;s no reason on earth why Cyril
      shouldn&rsquo;t run on for years yet as usual; and if Cyril got smashed,
      there&rsquo;s no reason on earth why I should ever know anything about it
      except from the newspapers.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. &mdash; INSIDE THE TUNNEL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And, indeed, if brain-waves had been in question at all, they ought,
      without a doubt, to have informed Guy Waring that at the very moment when
      he was going out to send off his telegram, his brother Cyril was sitting
      disconsolate, with dark blue lips and swollen eyelids, on the footboard of
      the railway carriage in the Lavington tunnel. Cyril was worn out with
      digging by this time, for he had done his best once more to clear away the
      sand towards the front of the train in the vague hope that he might
      succeed in letting in a little more air to their narrow prison through the
      chinks and interstices of the fallen sandstone. Besides, a man in an
      emergency must do something, if only to justify his claim to manliness&mdash;especially
      when a lady is looking on at his efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Cyril Waring had toiled and moiled in that deadly atmosphere for some
      hours in vain, and now sat, wearied out and faint from foul vapours, by
      Elma&rsquo;s side on the damp, cold footboard. By this time the air had
      almost failed them. They gasped for breath, their heads swam vaguely. A
      terrible weight seemed to oppress their bosoms. Even the lamps in the
      carriages flickered low and burned blue. The atmosphere of the tunnel,
      loaded from the very beginning with sulphurous smoke, was now all but
      exhausted. Death stared them in the face without hope of respite&mdash;a
      ghastly, slow death by gradual stifling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You MUST take a little water,&rdquo; Elma murmured, pouring out the
      last few drops for him into the tin cup&mdash;for Cyril had brought a
      small bottleful that morning for his painting, as well as a packet of
      sandwiches for lunch. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re dreadfully tired. I can see your
      lips are parched and dry with digging.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was deathly pale herself, and her own eyes were livid, for by this
      time she had fairly given up all hope of rescue; and, besides, the air in
      the tunnel was so foul and stupefying, she could hardly speak; indeed, her
      tongue clung to her palate. But she poured out the last few drops into the
      cup for Cyril and held them up imploringly, with a gesture of
      supplication. These two were no strangers to one another now. They had
      begun to know each other well in those twelve long hours of deadly peril
      shared in common.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril waved the cup aside with a firm air of dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said, faintly, &ldquo;you must drink it yourself.
      Your need is greater far than mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma tried to put it away in turn, but Cyril would not allow her. So she
      moistened her mouth with those scanty last drops, and turned towards him
      gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hope left now,&rdquo; she said, in a very resigned
      voice. &ldquo;We must make up our minds to die where we stand. But I thank
      you, oh, I thank you so much, so earnestly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril, for his part, could hardly find breath to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he gasped out, in one last despairing effort.
      &ldquo;Things look very black; but while there&rsquo;s life there&rsquo;s
      hope. They may even still, perhaps, come up with us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, a sound broke unexpectedly on the silence of their prison. A
      dull thud seemed to make itself faintly heard from beyond the thick wall
      of sand that cut them off from the daylight. Cyril stared with surprise.
      It was a noise like a pick-axe. Stooping hastily down, he laid his ear
      against the rail beside the shattered carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re digging!&rdquo; he cried earnestly, finding words in
      his joy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re digging to reach us! I can hear them! I can
      hear them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma glanced up at him with a certain tinge of half-incredulous surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re digging, of course,&rdquo; she said quickly.
      &ldquo;I knew they&rsquo;d dig for us, naturally, as soon as they missed
      us. But how far off are they yet? That&rsquo;s the real question. Will
      they reach us in time? Are they near or distant?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril knelt down on the ground as before, in an agony of suspense, and
      struck the rail three times distinctly with his walking-stick. Then he put
      his ear to it and listened, and waited. In less than half a minute three
      answering knocks rang, dim but unmistakable, along the buried rail. He
      could even feel the vibration on the iron with his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They hear us! They hear us!&rdquo; he cried once more, in a tremor
      of excitement. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re far off. They&rsquo;re
      coming rapidly towards us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the words Elma rose from her seat, still paler than ever, but strangely
      resolute, and took the stick from his hand with a gesture of despair. She
      was almost stifled. But she raised it with method. Knocking the rail
      twice, she bent down her head and listened in turn. Once more two
      answering knocks rang sharp along the connecting line of metal. Elma shook
      her head ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, they&rsquo;re a very long way off still,&rdquo; she
      murmured, in a faltering tone. &ldquo;I can hear it quite well. They can
      never reach us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She seated herself on a fragment of the broken carriage, and buried her
      face in her hands once more in silence. Her heart was full. Her head was
      very heavy. She gasped and struggled. Then a sudden intuition seized her,
      after her kind. If the rail could carry the sound of a tap, surely it
      might carry the human voice as well. Inspired with the idea, she rose
      again and leant forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second time she knocked two quick little taps, ringing sharp on the
      rail, as if to bespeak attention; then, putting her mouth close to the
      metals, she shouted aloud along them with all the voice that was left her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, there, do you hear? Come soon, come fast. We&rsquo;re alive,
      but choking!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick as lightning an answer rang back as if by magic, along the
      conducting line of the rail&mdash;a strange unexpected answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break the pipe of the wires,&rdquo; it said, and then subsided
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril, who was leaning down at her side at the moment with his ear to the
      rail, couldn&rsquo;t make out one word of it. But Elma&rsquo;s sharp
      senses, now quickened by the crisis, were acute as an Oriental&rsquo;s and
      keen as a beagle&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break the pipe of the wires,&rdquo; they say, she exclaimed,
      starting back and pondering. &ldquo;What on earth can they mean by that?
      What on earth can they be driving at? &lsquo;Break the pipe of the wires.&rsquo;
      I don&rsquo;t understand them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had she spoken, when another sharp tap resounded still more clearly
      along the rail at her feet. She bent down her head once more, and laid her
      eager ear beside it in terrible suspense. A rough man&rsquo;s voice&mdash;a
      navvy&rsquo;s, no doubt, or a fireman&rsquo;s&mdash;came speeding along
      the metal; and it said in thick accents&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear what I say? If you want to breathe freer, break the
      pipe of the wires, and you&rsquo;ll get fresh air from outside right
      through it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril this time had caught the words, and jumped up with a sudden air of
      profound conviction. It was very dark, and the lamps were going out, but
      he took his fusee-box from his pocket and struck a light hastily. Sure
      enough, on the left-hand side of the tunnel, half buried in rubbish, an
      earthenware pipe ran along by the edge near the wall of the archway. Cyril
      raised his foot and brought his heel down upon it sharply with all the
      strength and force he had still left in him. The pipe broke short, and
      Cyril saw within it a number of telegraph wires for the railway service.
      The tube communicated directly with the air outside. They were saved! They
      were saved! Air would come through the pipe! He saw it all now! He dimly
      understood it!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the self-same moment, another sound of breaking was heard more
      distinctly at the opposite end, some thirty or forty feet off through the
      tunnel. Then a voice rang far clearer, as if issuing from the tube, in
      short, sharp sentences&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pump you in air. How many of you are there? Are you all
      alive? Is any one injured?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril leant down and shouted back in reply&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re two. Both alive. Not hurt. But sick and half dead with
      stifling. Send us air as soon as ever you can. And if possible pass us a
      bottle of water.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes elapsed&mdash;three long, slow minutes of it&mdash;intense
      anxiety. Elma, now broken down with terror and want of oxygen, fell half
      fainting forward towards the shattered tube. Cyril held her up in his
      supporting arms, and watched the pipe eagerly. It seemed an age; but,
      after a time, he became conscious of a gust of air blowing cold on his
      face. The keen freshness revived him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked about him and drew a deep breath. Cool air was streaming in
      through the broken place. Quick as thought, he laid Elma&rsquo;s mouth as
      close as he could lay it to the reviving current. Her eyes were closed.
      After a painful interval, she opened them languidly. Cyril chafed her
      hands with his, but his chafing seemed to produce very little effect. She
      lay motionless now with her eyelids half shut, and the whites of her eyes
      alone showing through them. The close, foul air of that damp and confined
      spot had worked its worst, and had almost asphyxiated her. Cyril began to
      fear the slight relief had arrived five minutes too late. And it must
      still in all probability be some hours at least before they could be
      actually disentombed from that living vault or restored to the open air of
      heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he bent over her and held his breath in speechless suspense, the voice
      called out again more loudly than ever&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for the ball in the tube. We&rsquo;re sending you water!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril watched the pipe closely and struck another light. In a minute, a
      big glass marble came rattling through, with a string attached to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull the string!&rdquo; the voice cried; and Cyril pulled with a
      will. Now and again, the object attached to it struck against some
      projecting ledge or angle where the pipes overlapped. But at last, with a
      little humouring, it came through in safety. At the end was a large
      india-rubber bottle, full of fresh water, and a flask of brandy. The young
      man seized them both with delight and avidity, and bathed Elma&rsquo;s
      temples over and over again with the refreshing spirit. Then he poured a
      little into the cup, and filling it up with water, held it to her lips
      with all a woman&rsquo;s tenderness. Elma gulped the draught down
      unconsciously, and opened her eyes at once. For a moment she stared about
      her with a wild stare of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, of a sudden, she recollected where she was, and why, and seizing
      Cyril&rsquo;s hand, pressed it long and eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only we can hold out for three hours more,&rdquo; she cried,
      with fresh hope returning, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll reach us; I&rsquo;m
      sure they&rsquo;ll reach us!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. &mdash; GRATITUDE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were only two of you, then, in the last carriage?&rdquo; Guy
      asked with deep interest, the very next morning, as Cyril, none the worse
      for his long imprisonment, sat quietly in their joint chambers at Staple
      Inn, recounting the previous day&rsquo;s adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Only two of us. It was awfully fortunate. And the carriage
      that was smashed had nobody at all, except in the first compartment, which
      escaped being buried. So there were no lives lost, by a miracle, you may
      say. But several of the people in the front part of the train got terribly
      shaken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you and the other man were shut up in the tunnel there for
      fifteen hours at a stretch?&rdquo; Guy went on reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least fifteen hours,&rdquo; Cyril echoed, without attempting to
      correct the slight error of sex, for no man, he thought, is bound to
      criminate himself, even in a flirtation. &ldquo;It was two in the morning
      before they dug us quite out. And my companion by that time was more dead
      than alive, I can tell you, with watching and terror.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he, poor fellow?&rdquo; Guy murmured, with a sympathetic face;
      for Cyril had always alluded casually to his fellow-traveller in such
      general terms that Guy was as yet unaware there was a lady in the case.
      &ldquo;And is he all right again now, do you know? Have you heard anything
      more about him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But before Cyril could answer there came a knock at the door, and the next
      moment Mr. Montague Nevitt, without his violin, entered the room in some
      haste, all agog with excitement. His face was eager and his manner
      cordial. It was clear he was full of some important tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cyril, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he cried, grasping the painter&rsquo;s
      hand with much demonstration of friendly warmth, and wringing it hard two
      or three times over, &ldquo;how delighted I am to see you restored to us
      alive and well once more. This is really too happy. What a marvellous
      escape! And what a romantic story! All the clubs are buzzing with it. A
      charming girl! You&rsquo;ll have to marry her, of course, that&rsquo;s the
      necessary climax. You and the young lady are the staple of news, I see, in
      very big print, in all the evening papers!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy drew back at the words with a little start of surprise. &ldquo;Young
      lady!&rdquo; he cried aghast. &ldquo;A charming girl, Nevitt! Then the
      person who was shut up with you for fifteen hours in the tunnel was a
      girl, Cyril!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril&rsquo;s handsome face flushed slightly before his brother&rsquo;s
      scrutinizing gaze; but he answered with a certain little ill-concealed
      embarrassment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t say so, didn&rsquo;t I? Well, she WAS a girl
      then, of course; a certain Miss Clifford. She got in at Chetwood. Her
      people live somewhere down there near Tilgate. At least, so I gathered
      from what she told me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt stared hard at the painter&rsquo;s eyes, which tried, without
      success, to look unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A romance!&rdquo; he said, slowly, scanning his man with deep
      interest. &ldquo;A romance, I can see. Young, rich, and beautiful. My dear
      Cyril, I only wish I&rsquo;d had half your luck. What a splendid chance,
      and what a magnificent introduction! Beauty in distress! A lady in
      trouble! You console her alone in a tunnel for fifteen hours by yourself
      at a stretch. Heavens, what a tete-a-tete! Did British propriety ever
      before allow a man such a glorious opportunity for chivalrous devotion to
      a lady of family, face, and fortune?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she pretty?&rdquo; Guy asked, coming down at once to a more
      realistic platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril hesitated a moment. &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; he answered, somewhat
      curtly, after a short pause. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s distinctly good-looking.&rdquo;
      And he shut his mouth sharp. But he had said quite enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a man says that of a girl, and nothing more, in an unconcerned voice,
      as if it didn&rsquo;t matter twopence to him, you may be perfectly sure in
      your own mind he&rsquo;s very deeply and seriously smitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And young?&rdquo; Guy continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say about twenty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And rich beyond the utmost dreams of avarice?&rdquo; Montague
      Nevitt put in, with a faintly cynical smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; Cyril answered
      truthfully. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea who she is, even. She
      and I had other things to think about, you may be sure, boxed up there so
      long in that narrow space, and choking for want of air, than minute
      investigations into one another&rsquo;s pedigrees.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WE&rsquo;VE got no pedigree,&rdquo; Guy interposed, with a bitter
      smile. &ldquo;So the less she investigates about that the better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But SHE has, I expect,&rdquo; Nevitt put in hastily; &ldquo;and if
      I were you, Cyril, I&rsquo;d hunt her up forthwith, while the iron&rsquo;s
      hot, and find out all there is to find out about her. Clifford-Clifford? I
      wonder whether by any chance she&rsquo;s one of the Devonshire Cliffords,
      now? For if so, she might really be worth a man&rsquo;s serious attention.
      They&rsquo;re very good business. They bank at our place; and they&rsquo;re
      by no means paupers.&rdquo; For Nevitt was a clerk in the well-known
      banking firm of Drummond, Coutts, and Barclay, Limited; and being a man
      who didn&rsquo;t mean, as he himself said, &ldquo;to throw himself away on
      any girl for nothing,&rdquo; he kept a sharp look-out on the current
      account of every wealthy client with an only daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later, as the talk ran on, some further light was unexpectedly
      thrown upon this interesting topic by the entrance of the porter with a
      letter for Cyril. The painter tore it open, and glanced over it, as Nevitt
      observed, with evident eagerness. It was short and curt, but in its own
      way courteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Reginald Clifford, C.M.G., desires to thank Mr. Cyril
      Waring for his kindness and consideration to Miss Clifford during her
      temporary incarceration&mdash;-&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incarceration&rsquo;s good, isn&rsquo;t it? How much does he charge
      a thousand for that sort, I wonder?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;during her temporary incarceration in the Lavington tunnel
      yesterday. Mrs. and Miss Clifford wish also to express at the same time
      their deep gratitude to Mr. Waring for his friendly efforts, and trust he
      has experienced no further ill effects from the unfortunate accident to
      which he was subjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Craighton, Tilgate, Thursday morning.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She MIGHT have written herself,&rdquo; Cyril murmured half aloud.
      He was evidently disappointed at this very short measure of correspondence
      on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Montague Nevitt took a more cheerful view. &ldquo;Oh, Reginald
      Clifford, of Craighton!&rdquo; he cried with a smile, his invariable
      smile. &ldquo;I know all about HIM. He&rsquo;s a friend of Colonel
      Kelmscott&rsquo;s down at Tilgate Park. C.M.G., indeed! What a ridiculous
      old peacock. He was administrator of St. Kitts once upon a time, I
      believe, or was it Nevis or Antigua? I don&rsquo;t quite recollect, I&rsquo;m
      afraid; but anyhow, some comical little speck of a sugary, niggery, West
      Indian Island; and he was made a Companion of St. Michael and St. George
      when his term was up, just to keep him quiet, don&rsquo;t you know, for he
      wanted a knighthood, and to shelve him from being appointed to a
      first-class post like Barbados or Trinidad. If it&rsquo;s Elma Clifford
      you were shut up with in the tunnel, Cyril, you might do worse, there&rsquo;s
      no doubt, and you might do better. She&rsquo;s an only daughter, and there&rsquo;s
      a little money at the back of the family, I expect; but I fancy the
      Companion of the Fighting Saints lives mainly on his pension, which, of
      course, is purely personal, and so dies with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril folded up the note without noticing Nevitt&rsquo;s words and put it
      in his pocket, somewhat carefully and obtrusively. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
      he said, in a very quiet tone, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you about Miss
      Clifford&rsquo;s fortune. When I want information on that point I&rsquo;ll
      apply for it plainly. But meanwhile I don&rsquo;t think any lady&rsquo;s
      name should be dragged into conversation and bandied about like that, by
      an absolute stranger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, now you needn&rsquo;t be huffy,&rdquo; Nevitt answered, with a
      still sweeter smile, showing all those pearly teeth of his to the greatest
      advantage. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to put your back up, and I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what I&rsquo;ll do for you. I&rsquo;ll heap coals of fire on your
      head, you ungrateful man. I&rsquo;ll return good for evil. You shall have
      an invitation to Mrs. Holker&rsquo;s garden party on Saturday week at
      Chetwood Court, and there you&rsquo;ll be almost sure to meet the
      beautiful stranger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But at that very moment, at Craighton, Tilgate, Mr. Reginald Clifford,
      C.M.G., a stiff little withered-up official Briton, half mummified by long
      exposure to tropical suns, was sitting in his drawing-room with Mrs.
      Clifford, his wife, and discussing&mdash;what subject of all others on
      earth but the personality of Cyril Waring?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was an awkward situation for Elma, of course, I admit,&rdquo;
      he was chirping out cheerfully, with his back turned by pure force of
      habit to the empty grate, and his hands crossed behind him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      deny it was an awkward situation. Still, there&rsquo;s no harm done, I
      hope and trust. Elma&rsquo;s happily not a fanciful or foolishly
      susceptible sort of girl. She sees it&rsquo;s a case for mere ordinary
      gratitude. And gratitude, in my opinion, towards a person in his position,
      is sufficiently expressed once for all by letter. There&rsquo;s no reason
      on earth she should ever again see or hear any more of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But girls are so romantic,&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford put in doubtfully,
      with an anxious air. She herself was by no means romantic to look at,
      being, indeed, a person of a certain age, with a plump, matronly figure,
      and very staid of countenance; yet there was something in her eye, for all
      that, that recalled at times the vivid keenness of Elma&rsquo;s, and her
      cheek had once been as delicate and creamy a brown as her pretty daughter&rsquo;s.
      &ldquo;Girls are so romantic,&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford repeated once more, in
      a dreamy way, &ldquo;and she was evidently impressed by him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad I made inquiries at once about these two young
      men, anyhow,&rdquo; the Companion of St. Michael and St. George responded
      with fervour, clasping his wizened little hands contentedly over his
      narrow waistcoat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a precious odd story, and a doubtful
      story, and not at all the sort of story one likes one&rsquo;s girl to be
      any way mixed up with. For my part, I shall give them a very wide berth
      indeed in future; and there&rsquo;s no reason why Elma should ever knock
      up against them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you they were nobodies?&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford inquired,
      drawing a wistful sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Tom Clark was at school with them,&rdquo; the ex-administrator
      continued, with a very cunning air, &ldquo;and he knows all about them&mdash;has
      heard the whole circumstances. Very odd, very odd; never met anything so
      queer in all my life; most mysterious and uncanny. They never had a
      father; they never had a mother; they never had anybody on earth they
      could call their own; they dropped from the clouds, as it were, one rainy
      day, without a friend in the world, plump down into the Charterhouse.
      There they were well supplied with money, and spent their holidays with a
      person at Brighton, who wasn&rsquo;t even supposed to be their lawful
      guardian. Looks fishy, doesn&rsquo;t it? Their names are Cyril and Guy
      Waring&mdash;and that&rsquo;s all they know of themselves. They were
      educated like gentlemen till they were twenty-one years old; and then they
      were turned loose upon the world, like a pair of young bears, with a
      couple of hundred pounds of capital apiece to shift for themselves with.
      Uncanny, very; I don&rsquo;t like the look of it. Not at all the sort of
      people an impressionable girl like our Elma should ever be allowed to see
      too much of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she was very much impressed by him,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Clifford said with confidence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve watched her to see, and I
      don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s in love with him. But by to-morrow,
      Reginald, I shall be able, I&rsquo;m sure, to tell you for certain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Companion of the Militant Saints glanced rather uneasily across the
      hearth-rug at his wife. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a marvellous gift, to be sure,
      this intuition of yours, Louisa,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head sagely,
      and swaying himself gently to and fro on the stone kerb of the fender.
      &ldquo;I frankly confess, my dear, I don&rsquo;t quite understand it. And
      Elma&rsquo;s got it too, every bit as bad as you have. Runs in the family,
      I suppose&mdash;runs somehow in the family. After living with you now for
      twenty-two years&mdash;yes, twenty-two last April&mdash;in every part of
      the world and every grade of the service, I&rsquo;m compelled to admit
      that your intuition in these matters is really remarkable&mdash;simply
      remarkable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clifford coloured through her olive-brown skin, exactly like Elma,
      and rose with a somewhat embarrassed and half-guilty air, avoiding her
      husband&rsquo;s eyes as if afraid to meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma had gone to bed early, wearied out as she was with her long agony in
      the tunnel. Mrs. Clifford crept up to her daughter&rsquo;s room with a
      silent tread, like some noiseless Oriental, and, putting her ear to the
      keyhole, listened outside the door in profound suspense for several
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a sound from within; not a gentle footfall on the carpeted floor. For
      a moment she hesitated; then she turned the handle slowly, and, peering
      before her, peeped into the room. Thank Heaven! no snake signs. Elma lay
      asleep, with one arm above her head, as peacefully as a child, after her
      terrible adventure. Her bosom heaved, but slowly and regularly. The mother
      drew a deep breath, and crept down the stairs with a palpitating heart to
      the drawing-room again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reginald,&rdquo; she said, with perfect confidence, relapsing once
      more at a bound into the ordinary every-day British matron, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      no harm done, I&rsquo;m sure. She doesn&rsquo;t think of this young man at
      all. You may dismiss him from your mind at once and for ever. She&rsquo;s
      sleeping like a baby.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. &mdash; TWO STRANGE MEETINGS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Hugh Holker, at home, Saturday, May 29th, 3 to 6.30. Chetwood
      Court; tennis.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril Waring read it out with a little thrill of triumph. To be sure, it
      was by no means certain that Elma would be there; but still, Chetwood
      Court was well within range of Tilgate town, and Montague Nevitt felt
      convinced, he said, the Holkers were friends of the Cliffords and the
      Kelmscotts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; Guy remarked, balancing a fragment of fried
      sole on his fork as he spoke, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going all that way down
      to Chetwood merely to swell Mrs. Holker&rsquo;s triumph.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I were you,&rdquo; Cyril answered, with quiet
      incisiveness. He hadn&rsquo;t exactly fallen in love with Elma at first
      sight, but he was very much interested in her, and it struck him at once
      that what interested him was likely also to interest his twin brother. And
      this is just one of those rare cases in life where a man prefers that his
      interest in a subject should not be shared by any other person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Saturday, the 29th, arrived, however, Guy had so far changed his
      mind in the matter, that he presented himself duly with Nevitt at Waterloo
      to catch the same train to Chetwood station that Cyril went down by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said to Nevitt, as they walked together from
      the club in Piccadilly, &ldquo;I may as well see what the girl&rsquo;s
      like, anyhow. If she&rsquo;s got to be my sister-in-law&mdash;which seems
      not unlikely now&mdash;I&rsquo;d better have a look at her beforehand, so
      to speak, on approbation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Holkers&rsquo; grounds were large and well planted, with velvety lawns
      on the slope of a well-wooded hill overlooking the boundless blue weald of
      Surrey. Nevitt and the Warings were late to arrive, and found most of the
      guests already assembled before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time Guy found himself, to his intense chagrin, told off by his
      hostess to do the honours to an amiable old lady of high tonnage and great
      conversational powers, who rattled on uninterruptedly in one silvery
      stream about everybody on the ground, their histories and their pedigrees.
      She took the talking so completely off his hands, however, that, after a
      very few minutes, Guy, who was by nature of a lazy and contemplative
      disposition, had almost ceased to trouble himself about what she said,
      interposing &ldquo;indeeds&rdquo; and &ldquo;reallys&rdquo; with automatic
      politeness at measured intervals; when suddenly the old lady, coming upon
      a bench where a mother and daughter were seated in the shade, settled down
      by their sides in a fervour of welcome, and shook hands with them both
      effusively in a most demonstrative fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughter was pretty&mdash;yes, distinctly pretty. She attracted Guy&rsquo;s
      attention at once by the piercing keenness of her lustrous dark eyes, and
      the delicate olive-brown of her transparent complexion. Her expression was
      merry, but with a strange and attractive undertone, he thought, of some
      mysterious charm. A more taking girl, indeed, now he came to look close,
      he hadn&rsquo;t seen for months. He congratulated himself on his garrulous
      old lady&rsquo;s choice of a bench to sit upon, if it helped him to an
      introduction to the beautiful stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before he could even be introduced, the pretty girl with the
      olive-brown complexion had held out her hand to him frankly, and exclaimed
      in a voice as sunny as her face&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to be told your friend&rsquo;s name, I&rsquo;m
      sure, Mrs. Godfrey. He&rsquo;s so awfully like him. I should have known
      him anywhere. Of course, you&rsquo;re Mr. Waring&rsquo;s brother, aren&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy smiled, and bowed gracefully; he was always graceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse to be merely MR. WARING&rsquo;S BROTHER,&rdquo; he
      answered, with some amusement, as he took the proffered hand in his own
      warmly. &ldquo;If it comes to that, I&rsquo;m Mr. Waring myself; and
      Cyril, whom you seem to know already, is only my brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but MY Mr. Waring isn&rsquo;t here to-day, is he?&rdquo; the
      olive-brown girl put in, looking around with quite an eager interest at
      the crowd in the distance. &ldquo;Naturally, to me, he&rsquo;s THE Mr.
      Waring, of course, and you are only MY Mr. Waring&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elma, my dear, what on earth will Mr. Waring think of you?&rdquo;
      her mother put in, with the conventional shocked face of British
      propriety. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she went on, turning round quickly to
      Guy, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all so grateful to your brother for his kindness
      to our girl in that dreadful accident the other day at Lavington, that we
      can&rsquo;t help thinking and talking of him all the time as our Mr.
      Waring. I&rsquo;m sorry he isn&rsquo;t here himself this afternoon to
      receive our thanks. It would be such a pleasure to all of us to give them
      to him in person.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is about, somewhere,&rdquo; Guy answered carelessly, still
      keeping his eye fixed hard on the pretty girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch him
      round by-and-by to pay his respects in due form. He&rsquo;ll be only too
      glad. And this, I suppose, must be Miss Clifford that I&rsquo;ve heard so
      much about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said those words, a little gleam of pleasure shot through Elma&rsquo;s
      eyes. Her painter hadn&rsquo;t forgotten her, then. He had talked much
      about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew who you must be the very first moment I saw you,&rdquo;
      she answered, blushing; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re so much like him in some ways,
      though not in all.... And he told me that day he had a twin brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much like him in some ways,&rdquo; Guy repeated, much amused.
      &ldquo;Why, I wonder you don&rsquo;t take me for Cyril himself at once.
      You&rsquo;re the very first person I ever knew in my life, except a few
      old and very intimate friends, who could tell at all the difference
      between us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma drew back, almost as if shocked and hurt at the bare suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear no,&rdquo; she cried quickly, scanning him over at once
      with those piercing keen eyes of hers; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re like him, of
      course&mdash;I don&rsquo;t deny the likeness&mdash;as brothers may be like
      one another. Your features are the same, and the colour of your hair and
      eyes, and all that sort of thing; but still, I knew at a glance you weren&rsquo;t
      my Mr. Waring. I could never mistake you for him. The expression and the
      look are so utterly different.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be a very subtle judge of faces,&rdquo; the young man
      answered, still smiling, &ldquo;if you knew us apart at first sight; for I
      never before in my life met anybody who&rsquo;d seen my brother once or
      twice, and who didn&rsquo;t take me for him, or him for me, the very first
      time he saw us apart. But then,&rdquo; he added, after a short pause, with
      a quick dart of his eyes, &ldquo;you were with him in the tunnel for a
      whole long day; and in that time, of course, you saw a good deal of him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma blushed again, and Guy noticed in passing that she blushed very
      prettily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how&rsquo;s Sardanapalus?&rdquo; she asked, in a somewhat
      hurried voice, making an inartistic attempt to change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sardanapalus is all right,&rdquo; Guy answered, laughing.
      &ldquo;Cyril told me you had made friends with him, and weren&rsquo;t one
      bit afraid of him. Most people are so dreadfully frightened of the poor
      old creature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t old,&rdquo; Elma exclaimed, interrupting him
      with some warmth. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the prime of life. He&rsquo;s so
      glossy and beautiful. I quite fell in love with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is Sardanapalus?&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford asked, with a vague
      maternal sense of discomfort and doubt. &ldquo;A dog or a monkey?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sardanapalus, mother&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I tell you about him?&rdquo;
      Elma cried enthusiastically. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s just lovely and
      beautiful. He&rsquo;s such a glorious green and yellow-banded snake; and
      he coiled around my arm as if he&rsquo;d always known me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clifford drew back with a horror-stricken face, darting across at her
      daughter the same stealthy sort of look she had given her husband the
      night after Elma&rsquo;s adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A snake!&rdquo; she repeated, aghast, &ldquo;a snake! Oh, Elma!
      Why, you never told me that. And he coiled round your arm. How horrible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Elma wasn&rsquo;t to be put down by exclamations of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re not afraid of snakes yourself, you know, mother,&rdquo;
      she went on, undismayed. &ldquo;I remember papa saying that when you were
      at St. Kitts with him you never minded them a bit, but caught them in your
      hands like an Indian juggler, and treated them as playthings, so I wasn&rsquo;t
      afraid either. I suppose it&rsquo;s hereditary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clifford gazed at her fixedly for a few seconds with a very pale
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is,&rdquo; she said slowly and stiffly, with an
      evident effort. &ldquo;Most things are, in fact, in this world we live in.
      But I didn&rsquo;t know YOU at least had inherited it, Elma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment they were relieved from the temporary embarrassment
      which the mention of Sardanapalus seemed to have caused the party, by the
      approach of a tall and very handsome man, who came forward with a smile
      towards where their group was standing. He was military in bearing, and
      had dark brown hair, with a white moustache; but he hardly looked more
      than fifty for all that, as Guy judged at once from his erect carriage and
      the singular youthfulness of both face and figure. That he was a born
      aristocrat one could see in every motion of his well-built limbs. His mien
      had that ineffable air of grace and breeding which sometimes marks the
      members of our old English families. Very much like Cyril, too, Guy
      thought to himself, in a flash of intuition; very much like Cyril, the way
      he raised his hat and then smiled urbanely on Mrs. Clifford and Elma. But
      it was Cyril grown old and prematurely white, and filled full with the
      grave haughtiness of an honoured aristocrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s Colonel Kelmscott!&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford
      exclaimed, with a sigh of relief, not a little set at ease by the timely
      diversion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so glad you&rsquo;ve come, Colonel. And Lady
      Emily too; she&rsquo;s over yonder, is she? Ah, well, I&rsquo;ll look out
      for her. We heard you were to be here. Oh, how kind of you; thank you. No,
      Elma&rsquo;s none the worse for her adventure, thank Heaven! just a little
      shaken, that&rsquo;s all, but not otherwise injured. And this gentleman&rsquo;s
      the brother of the kind friend who was so good to her in the tunnel. I&rsquo;m
      not quite sure of the name. I think it&rsquo;s&mdash;-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guy Waring,&rdquo; the young man interposed blandly. Hardly any one
      who looked at Colonel Kelmscott&rsquo;s eyes could even have perceived the
      profound surprise this announcement caused him. He bowed without moving a
      muscle of that military face. Guy himself never noticed the intense
      emotion the introduction aroused in the distinguished stranger. But Mrs.
      Clifford and Elma, each scanning him closely with those keen grey eyes of
      theirs, observed at once that, unmoved as he appeared, a thunderbolt
      falling at Colonel Kelmscott&rsquo;s feet could not more thoroughly or
      completely have stunned him. For a second or two he gazed in the young man&rsquo;s
      face uneasily, his colour came and went, his bosom heaved in silence; then
      he roped his moustache with his trembling fingers, and tried in vain to
      pump up some harmless remark appropriate to the occasion. But no remark
      came to him. Mrs. Clifford darted a furtive glance at Elma, and Elma
      darted back a furtive glance at Mrs. Clifford. Neither said a word, and
      each let her eyes drop to the ground at once as they met the other&rsquo;s.
      But each knew in her heart that something passing strange had astonished
      Colonel Kelmscott; and each knew, too, that the other had observed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother and daughter, indeed, needed no spoken words to tell these things
      plainly to one another. The deep intuition that descended to both was
      enough to put them in sympathy at once without the need of articulate
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Guy Waring,&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford repeated at last,
      breaking the awkward silence that supervened upon the group. &ldquo;The
      brother of Mr. Cyril Waring, who was so kind the other day to my daughter
      in the tunnel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel started imperceptibly to the naked eye again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; he said, forcing himself with an effort to speak
      at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read about it, of course; it was in all the
      papers.... And&mdash;eh&mdash;is your brother here, too, this afternoon,
      Mr. Waring?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. &mdash; KELMSCOTT OF TILGATE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To both Elma and her mother this meeting between Colonel Kelmscott and Guy
      Waring was full of mystery. For the Kelmscotts, of Tilgate Park, were the
      oldest county family in all that part of Surrey; and Colonel Kelmscott
      himself passed as the proudest man of that haughtiest house in Southern
      England. What, therefore, could have made him give so curious and almost
      imperceptible a start the moment Guy Waring&rsquo;s name was mentioned in
      conversation? Not a word that he said, to be sure, implied to Guy himself
      the depth of his surprise; but Elma, with her marvellous insight, could
      see at once, for all that, by the very haze in his eyes, that he was
      fascinated by Guy&rsquo;s personality, somewhat as she herself had been
      fascinated the other day in the train by Sardanapalus. Nay, more; he
      seemed to wish, with all his heart, to leave the young man&rsquo;s
      presence, and yet to be glued to the spot, in spite of himself, by some
      strange compulsion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a dreamy, far-away tone in his voice that the Colonel uttered
      those seemingly simple words, &ldquo;And is your brother here, too, this
      afternoon, Mr. Waring?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s somewhere about,&rdquo; Guy answered carelessly.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll turn up by-and-by, no doubt. He&rsquo;s pretty sure to
      find out, sooner or later, Miss Clifford&rsquo;s here, and then he&rsquo;ll
      come round this way to speak to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time they stood talking in a little group by the bench, Colonel
      Kelmscott meanwhile thawing by degrees and growing gradually interested in
      what Guy had to say, while Elma looked on with a devouring curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother&rsquo;s a painter, you say,&rdquo; the Colonel
      murmured once under that heavy white moustache of his; &ldquo;yes, I think
      I remember. A rising painter. Had a capital landscape in the Grosvenor
      last year, I recollect, and another in the Academy this spring, if I don&rsquo;t
      mistake&mdash;skied&mdash;skied, unfairly; yet a very pretty thing, too;
      &lsquo;At the Home of the Curlews.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s painting a sweet one now,&rdquo; Elma put in quickly,
      &ldquo;down here, close by, in Chetwood Forest. He told me about it; it
      must be simply lovely&mdash;all fern and mosses, with, oh! such a
      beautiful big snake in the foreground.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see it,&rdquo; Colonel Kelmscott said slowly, not
      without a pang. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s painted in the forest&mdash;and by
      your brother, Mr. Waring&mdash;that would give it, to me, a certain
      personal value.&rdquo; He paused a moment; then he added, in a little
      explanatory undertone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lord of the manor, you know, at
      Chetwood; and I shoot the forest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cyril would be delighted to let you see the piece when it&rsquo;s
      finished,&rdquo; Guy answered lightly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re ever up in
      town our way&mdash;we&rsquo;ve rooms in Staple Inn. I dare say you know it&mdash;that
      quaint, old-fashioned looking place, with big lattice windows, that
      overhangs Holborn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Kelmscott started, and drew himself up still taller and stiffer
      than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have some opportunity of seeing it some day in one of the
      galleries,&rdquo; he answered coldly, as if not to commit himself. &ldquo;To
      tell you the truth, I seldom have time to lounge about in studios. It was
      merely the coincidence of the picture being painted in Chetwood Forest
      that made me fancy for a moment I might like to see it. But I&rsquo;m no
      connoisseur. Mrs. Clifford, may I take you to get a cup of tea? Tea, I
      think, is laid out in the tent behind the shrubbery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said in a tone to dismiss Guy politely; and Guy, taking the hint,
      accepted it as such, and fell back a pace or two to his garrulous old
      lady. But before Colonel Kelmscott could walk off Mrs. Clifford and her
      daughter to the marquee for refreshments, Elma gave a sudden start, and
      blushed faintly pink through that olive-brown skin of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s MY Mr. Waring!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in a very
      pleased tone, holding out her hand, with a delicious smile; and as she
      said it, Cyril and Montague Nevitt strolled up from behind a great clump
      of lilacs beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two pairs of eyes watched those young folks closely as they shook hands
      once more&mdash;Guy&rsquo;s and Mrs. Clifford&rsquo;s. Guy observed that a
      little red spot rose on Cyril&rsquo;s cheek he had rarely seen there, and
      that his voice trembled slightly as he said, &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo;
      to his pretty fellow-traveller of the famous adventure. Mrs. Clifford
      observed that the faint pink faded out of the olive-brown skin as Elma
      took Cyril Waring&rsquo;s hand in hers, and that her face grew pale for
      three minutes afterwards. And Colonel Kelmscott, looking on with a quietly
      observant eye, remarked to himself that Cyril Waring was a very creditable
      young man indeed, as handsome as Guy, and as like as two peas, but if
      anything perhaps even a trifle more pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of that afternoon, they six kept constantly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma noted that Colonel Kelmscott was evidently ill at ease; a thing most
      unusual with that proud, self-reliant aristocrat. He held himself, to be
      sure, as straight and erect as ever, and moved about the grounds with that
      same haughty air of perfect supremacy, as of one who was monarch of all he
      surveyed in the county of Surrey. But Elma could see, for all that, that
      he was absent-minded and self-contained; he answered all questions in a
      distant, unthinking way; some inner trouble was undoubtedly consuming him.
      His eyes were all for the two Warings. They glanced nervously right and
      left every minute in haste, but returned after each excursion straight to
      Guy and Cyril. The Colonel noted narrowly all they said and did; and Elma
      was sure he was very much pleased at least with her painter. How could he
      fail to be, indeed?&mdash;for Mr. Waring was charming. Elma wished she
      could have strolled off with him about the lawn alone, were it only ten
      paces in front of her mother. But somehow the fates that day were
      unpropitious. The party held together as by some magnetic bond, and Mrs.
      Clifford&rsquo;s eye never for one moment deserted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel glowered. The Colonel was moody. His speech was curt. He
      occupied himself mainly in listening to Guy and Cyril. A sort of mesmeric
      influence seemed to draw him towards the two young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew them out deliberately. Yet the start he had given as either young
      man came up towards his side was a start, not of mere neutral surprise,
      but of positive disinclination and regret at the meeting. Nay, even now he
      was angling hard, with all the skill of a strategist, to keep the Warings
      out of Lady Emily&rsquo;s way. But the more he talked to them, the more
      interested he seemed. It was clear he meant to make the most of this
      passing chance&mdash;and never again, if he could help it, Elma felt
      certain, to see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, and once only, Granville Kelmscott, his son, strolled casually up
      and joined the group by pure chance for a few short minutes. The heir of
      Tilgate Park was tall and handsome, though less so than his father; and
      Mrs. Clifford was not wholly indisposed to throw him and Elma together as
      much as possible. Younger by a full year than the two Warings, Granville
      Kelmscott was not wholly unlike them in face and manner. As a rule, his
      father was proud of him, with a passing great pride, as he was proud of
      every other Kelmscott possession. But to-day, Elma&rsquo;s keen eye
      observed that the Colonel&rsquo;s glance moved quickly in a rapid dart
      from Cyril and Guy to his son Granville, and back again from his son
      Granville to Guy and Cyril. What was odder still, the hasty comparison
      seemed to redound not altogether to Granville&rsquo;s credit. The Colonel
      paused, and stifled a sigh as he looked; then, in spite of Mrs. Clifford&rsquo;s
      profound attempts to retain the heir by her side, he sent the young man
      off at a moment&rsquo;s notice to hunt up Lady Emily. Now why on earth did
      he want to keep Granville and the Warings apart? Mrs. Clifford and Elina
      racked their brains in vain; they could make nothing of the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long afternoon, and Elma enjoyed it, though she never got her
      tete-a-tete after all with Cyril Waring. Just a rapid look, a dart from
      the eyes, a faint pressure of her hand at parting&mdash;that was all the
      romance she was able to extract from it, so closely did Mrs. Clifford play
      her part as chaperon. But as the two young men and Montague Nevitt hurried
      off at last to catch their train back to town, the Colonel turned to Mrs.
      Clifford with a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid young fellows, those,&rdquo; he exclaimed, looking after
      them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry I met them. Ought to have gone into a
      cavalry regiment early in life; what fine leaders they&rsquo;d have made,
      to be sure, in a dash for the guns or a charge against a battery! But they
      seem to have done well for themselves in their own way: carved out their
      own fortunes, each after his fashion. Very plucky young fellows. One of
      them&rsquo;s a painter, and one&rsquo;s a journalist; and both of them are
      making their mark in their own world. I really admire them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And on the way to the station, that moment, Mr. Montague Nevitt, as he lit
      his cigarette, was saying to Cyril, with an approving smile, &ldquo;Your
      Miss Clifford&rsquo;s pretty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cyril answered drily, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not bad
      looking. She looked her best to-day. And she&rsquo;s capital company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Guy broke out unabashed into a sudden burst of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bad looking!&rdquo; he cried contemptuously. &ldquo;Is that all
      you have to say of her? And you a painter, too! Why, she&rsquo;s
      beautiful! She&rsquo;s charming! If Cyril was shut up in a tunnel with HER&mdash;-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for the rest of the way home he spoke but seldom. It was all too true.
      The two Warings were cast in the self-same mould. What attracted one, it
      was clear, no less surely and certainly attracted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went to their separate rooms in Staple Inn that night, Guy paused
      for a moment, candle in hand, by his door, and looked straight at Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t fear ME,&rdquo; he said, in a very low tone.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s yours. You found her. I wouldn&rsquo;t be mean enough
      for a minute to interfere with your find. But I&rsquo;m not surprised at
      you. I would do the same myself, if I could have seen her first. I won&rsquo;t
      see her again. I couldn&rsquo;t stand it. She&rsquo;s too beautiful to see
      and not to fall in love with.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; ELMA BREAKS OUT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clifford returned from Chetwood Court that clay in by no means such
      high spirits as when she went there. In the first place, she hadn&rsquo;t
      succeeded in throwing Elma and Granville Kelmscott into one another&rsquo;s
      company at all, and in the second place Elma had talked much under her
      very nose, for half-an-hour at a stretch, with the unknown young painter
      fellow. When Elma was asked out anywhere else in the country for the next
      six weeks or so, Mrs. Clifford made up her mind strictly to inquire in
      private, before committing herself to an acceptance, whether that
      dangerous young man was likely or not to be included in the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mrs. Clifford admitted frankly to herself that Cyril was dangerous; as
      dangerous as they make them. He was just the right age; he was handsome,
      he was clever, his tawny brown beard had the faintest little touch of
      artistic redness, and was trimmed and dressed with provoking nicety. He
      was an artist too; and girls nowadays, you know, have such an
      unaccountable way of falling in love with men who can paint, or write
      verses, or play the violin, or do something foolish of that sort, instead
      of sticking fast to the solid attractions of the London Stock Exchange or
      of ancestral acres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clifford confided her fears that very night to the sympathetic ear of
      the Companion of the Militant and Guardian Saints of the British Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reginald,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;I told you the other
      day, when you asked about it, Elma wasn&rsquo;t in love. And at the time I
      was right, or very near it. But this afternoon I&rsquo;ve had an
      opportunity of watching them both together, and I&rsquo;ve half changed my
      mind. Elma thinks a great deal too much altogether, I&rsquo;m afraid,
      about this young Mr. Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Mr. Clifford asked, staring her hard in the
      face, and nodding solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British matron hesitated. &ldquo;How do I know anything?&rdquo; she
      answered at last, driven to bay by the question. &ldquo;I never know how.
      I only know I know it. But whatever we do we must be careful not to let
      Elma and the young man get thrown together again. I should say myself it
      wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad plan if we were to send her away somewhere for the
      rest of the summer, but I can tell you better about all this to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma, for her part, had come home from Chetwood Court more full than ever
      of Cyril Waring. He looked so handsome and so manly that afternoon at the
      Holkers&rsquo;. Elma hoped she&rsquo;d be asked out where he was going to
      be again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat long in her own bedroom, thinking it over with herself, while the
      candle burnt down in its socket very low, and the house was still, and the
      rain pattered hard on the roof overhead, and her father and mother were
      discussing her by themselves downstairs in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat long on her chair without caring to begin undressing. She sat and
      mused with her hands crossed on her lap. She sat and thought, and her
      thoughts were all about Cyril Waring.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more than an hour she sat there dreamily, and told herself over, one
      by one, in long order, the afternoon&rsquo;s events from beginning to the
      end of them. She repeated every word Cyril had spoken in her ear. She
      remembered every glance, every look he had darted at her. She thought of
      that faint pressure of his hand as he said farewell. The tender blush came
      back to her brown cheek once more with maidenly shame as she told it all
      over. He was so handsome and so nice, and so very, very kind, and,
      perhaps, after this, she might never again meet him. Her bosom heaved. She
      was conscious of a new sense just aroused within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently her heart began to beat more violently. She didn&rsquo;t know
      why. It had never beaten in her life like that before&mdash;not even in
      the tunnel, nor yet when Cyril came up to-day and spoke first to her.
      Slowly, slowly, she rose from her seat. The fit was upon her. Could this
      be a dream? Some strange impulse made her glide forward and stand for a
      minute or two irresolute, in the middle of the room. Then she turned
      round, once, twice, thrice, half unconsciously. She turned round,
      wondering to herself all the while what this strange thing could mean;
      faster, faster, faster, her heart within her beating at each turn with
      more frantic haste and speed than ever. For some minutes she turned,
      glowing with red shame, yet unable to stop, and still more unable to say
      to herself why or wherefore.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first that was all. She merely turned and panted. But as she whirled
      and whirled, new moods and figures seemed to force themselves upon her.
      She lifted her hands and swayed them about above her head gracefully. She
      was posturing she knew, but why she had no idea. It all came upon her as
      suddenly and as uncontrollably as a blush. She was whirling around the
      room, now slow, now fast, but always with her arms held out lissom, like a
      dancing-girl&rsquo;s. Sometimes her body bent this way, and sometimes
      that, her hands keeping time to her movements meanwhile in long graceful
      curves, but all as if compelled by some extrinsic necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an instinct within her over which she had no control. Surely,
      surely, she must be possessed. A spirit that was not her seemed to be
      catching her round the waist, and twisting her about, and making her spin
      headlong over the floor through this wild fierce dance. It was terrible,
      terrible. Yet she could not prevent it. A force not her own seemed to
      sustain and impel her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the time, as she whirled, she was conscious also of some strange
      dim need. A sense of discomfort oppressed her arms. She hadn&rsquo;t
      everything she required for this solitary orgy. Something more was lacking
      her. Something essential, vital. But what on earth it could be she knew
      not; she knew not.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by she paused, and, as she glanced right and left, the sense of
      discomfort grew clearer and more vivid. It was her hands that were wrong.
      Her hands were empty. She must have something to fill them. Something
      alive, lithe, curling, sinuous. These wavings and swayings, to this side
      and to that, seemed so meaningless and void&mdash;without some life to
      guide them. There was nothing for her to hold; nothing to tame and subdue;
      nothing to cling and writhe and give point to her movements. Oh! heavens,
      how horrible!
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself up suddenly, and by dint of a fierce brief effort of will
      repressed for awhile the mad dance that overmastered her. The spirit
      within her, if spirit it were, kept quiet for a moment, awed and subdued
      by her proud determination. Then it began once more and led her
      resistlessly forward. She moved over to the chest of drawers still
      rhythmically and with set steps, but to the phantom strain of some unheard
      low music. The music was running vaguely through her head all the time&mdash;wild
      Aeolian music&mdash;it sounded like a rude tune on a harp or zither. And
      surely the cymbals clashed now and again overhead; and the timbrel rang
      clear; and the castanets tinkled, keeping time with the measure. She stood
      still and listened. No, no, not a sound save the rain on the roof. It was
      the music of her own heart, beating irregularly and fiercely to an
      intermittent lilt, like a Hungarian waltz or a Roumanian tarantella.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, Elina was thoroughly frightened. Was she going mad? she
      asked herself, or had some evil spirit taken up his abode within her? What
      made her spin and twirl about like this&mdash;irresponsibly,
      unintentionally, irrepressibly, meaninglessly? Oh, what would her mother
      say, if only she knew all? And what on earth would Cyril Waring think of
      her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril Waring! Cyril Waring! It was all Cyril Waring. And yet, if he knew&mdash;oh,
      mercy, mercy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, in spite of these doubts, misgivings, fears, she walked over
      towards the chest of drawers with a firm and rhythmical tread, to the bars
      of the internal music that rang loud through her brain, and began opening
      one drawer after another in an aimless fashion. She was looking for
      something&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t know what; and she never could rest now
      until she&rsquo;d found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawer upon drawer she opened and shut wearily, but nothing that her eyes
      fell upon seemed to suit her mood. Dresses and jackets and underlinen were
      there; she glanced at them all with a deep sense of profound contempt;
      none of these gewgaws of civilized life could be of any use to supply the
      vague want her soul felt so dimly and yet so acutely. They were dead,
      dead, dead, so close and clinging! Go further! Go further! At last she
      opened the bottom drawer of all, and her eye fell askance upon a feather
      boa, curled up at the bottom&mdash;soft, smooth, and long; a winding,
      coiling, serpentine boa. In a second, she had fallen upon it bodily with
      greedy hands, and was twisting it round her waist, and holding it high and
      low, and fighting fiercely at times, and figuring with it like a
      posturant. Some dormant impulse of her race seemed to stir in her blood,
      with frantic leaps and bounds, at its first conscious awakening. She gave
      herself up to it wildly now. She was mad. She was mad. She was glad. She
      was happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she began to turn round again, slowly, slowly, slowly. As she turned,
      she raised the boa now high above her head; now held it low on one side,
      now stooped down and caressed it. At times, as she played with it, the
      lifeless thing seemed to glide from her grasp in curling folds and elude
      her; at others, she caught it round the neck like a snake, and twisted it
      about her arm, or let it twine and encircle her writhing body. Like a
      snake! like a snake! That idea ran like wildfire through her burning
      veins. It was a snake, indeed, she wanted; a real live snake; what would
      she not have given, if it were only Sardanapalus!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sardanapalus, so glossy, so beautiful, so supple, that glorious green
      serpent, with his large smooth coils, and his silvery scales, and his
      darting red tongue, and his long lithe movements. Sardanapalus,
      Sardanapalus, Sardanapalus! The very name seemed to link itself with the
      music in her head. It coursed with her blood. It rang through her brain.
      And another as well. Cyril Waring, Cyril Waring, Cyril Waring, Cyril
      Waring! Oh! great heavens, what would Cyril Waring say now, if only he
      could see her in her mad mood that moment!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it was not she, not she, not she, but some spirit, some weird,
      some unseen power within her. It was no more she than that boa there was a
      snake. A real live snake. Oh, for a real live snake! And then she could
      dance&mdash;tarantel, tarantella&mdash;as the spirit within her prompted
      her to dance it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faster, faster,&rdquo; said the spirit; and she answered him back,
      &ldquo;Faster!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Faster, faster, faster, faster she whirled round the room; the boa grew
      alive; it coiled about her; it strangled her. Her candle failed; the wick
      in the socket flickered and died; but Elma danced on, unheeding, in the
      darkness. Dance, dance, dance, dance; never mind for the light! Oh! what
      madness was this? What insanity had come over her? Would her feet never
      stop? Must she go on till she dropped? Must she go on for ever?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashamed and terrified with her maidenly sense, overawed and obscured by
      this hateful charm, yet unable to stay herself, unable to resist it, in a
      transport of fear and remorse, she danced on irresponsibly. Check herself
      she couldn&rsquo;t, let her do what she would. Her whole being seemed to
      go forth into that weird, wild dance. She trembled and shook. She stood
      aghast at her own shame. She had hard work to restrain herself from crying
      aloud in her horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, a lull, a stillness, a recess. Her limbs seemed to yield and give
      way beneath her. She half fainted with fatigue. She staggered and fell.
      Too weary to undress, she flung herself upon the bed, just as she was,
      clothes and all. Her overwrought nerves lost consciousness at once. In
      three minutes she was asleep, breathing fast but peacefully.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. &mdash; AND AFTER?
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Elma woke up next morning, it was broad daylight. She woke with a
      start, to find herself lying upon the bed where she had flung herself. For
      a minute or two she couldn&rsquo;t recollect or recall to herself how it
      had all come about. It was too remote from anything in her previous waking
      thought, too dream-like, too impossible. Then an unspeakable horror
      flashed over her unawares. Her face flushed hot. Shame and terror overcame
      her. She buried her head in her hands in an agony of awe. Her own
      self-respect was literally outraged. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly remorse; it
      wasn&rsquo;t exactly fear; it was a strange creeping feeling of ineffable
      disgust and incredulous astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be but one explanation of this impossible episode. She must
      have gone mad all at once! She must be a frantic lunatic!
    </p>
    <p>
      A single thought usurped her whole soul. If she was going mad&mdash;if
      this was really mania&mdash;she could never, never, never&mdash;marry
      Cyril Waring.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in a flash of intuition she knew that now. She knew she was in love.
      She knew he loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that wild moment of awakening all the rest mattered nothing. The
      solitary idea that ran now through her head, as the impulse to dance had
      run through it last night, was the idea that she could never marry Cyril
      Waring. And if Cyril Waring could have seen her just then! her cheeks
      burned yet a brighter scarlet at that thought than even before. One
      virginal blush suffused her face from chin to forehead. The maidenly sense
      of shame consumed and devoured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she mad? Was she mad? And was this a lucid interval?
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, as she lay still on her bed all dressed, and with her face in
      her hands, trembling for very shame, a little knock sounded tentatively at
      the door of her bedroom. It was a timid, small knock, very low and soft,
      and, as it were, inquiring. It seemed to say in an apologetic sort of
      undertone, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re awake or not
      just yet; and if you&rsquo;re still asleep, pray don&rsquo;t let me for a
      moment disturb or arouse you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; Elma mustered up courage to ask, in a
      hushed voice of terror, hiding her head under the bed-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, darling,&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford answered, very softly
      and sweetly. Elma had never heard her mother speak in so tender and gentle
      a tone before, though they loved one another well, and were far more
      sympathetic than most mothers and daughters. And besides, that knock was
      so unlike mamma&rsquo;s. Why so soft and low?
    </p>
    <p>
      Had mamma discovered her? With a despairing sense of being caught she
      looked down at her tell-tale clothes and the unslept-in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what shall I ever do?&rdquo; she thought to herself,
      confusedly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let mamma come in and catch me like this.
      She&rsquo;ll ask why on earth I didn&rsquo;t undress last night. And then
      what could I ever say? How could I ever explain to her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The awful sense of shame-facedness grew upon her still more deeply than
      ever. She jumped up and whispered through the door, in a very penitent
      voice, &ldquo;Oh, mother, I can&rsquo;t let you in just yet. Do you mind
      waiting five minutes? Come again by-and-by. I&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m so
      awfully tired and queer this morning somehow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clifford&rsquo;s voice had an answering little ring of terror in it,
      as she replied at once, in the same soft tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, darling. That&rsquo;s all right. Stay as long as you
      like. Don&rsquo;t trouble to get up if you&rsquo;d rather have your
      breakfast in bed. And don&rsquo;t hurry yourself at all. I&rsquo;ll come
      back by-and-by and see what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma didn&rsquo;t know why, but by the very tone of her mother&rsquo;s
      voice she felt dimly conscious something strange had happened. Mrs.
      Clifford spoke with unusual gentleness, yet with an unwonted tremor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear,&rdquo; Elma answered through the door, going back
      to the bedside and beginning to undress in a tumult of shame. &ldquo;Come
      again by-and-by. In just five minutes.&rdquo; It would do her good, she
      knew, in spite of her shyness, to talk with her mother. Then she folded
      her clothes neatly, one by one, on a chair; hid the peccant boa away in
      its own lower drawer; buttoned her neat little embroidered nightdress
      tightly round her throat; arranged her front hair into a careless
      disorder; and tried to cool down her fiery red cheeks with copious bathing
      in cold water. When Mrs. Clifford came back five minutes later, everything
      looked to the outer eye of a mere casual observer exactly as if Elma had
      laid in bed all night, curled up between the sheets, in the most orthodox
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all these elaborate preparations didn&rsquo;t for one moment deceive
      the mother&rsquo;s watchful glance, or the keen intuition shared by all
      the women of the Clifford family. She looked tenderly at Elma&mdash;Elma
      with her face half buried in the pillows, and the tell-tale flush still
      crimsoning her cheek in a single round spot; then she turned for a second
      to the clothes, too neatly folded on the chair by the bedside, as she
      murmured low&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not well this morning, my child. You&rsquo;d better
      not get up. I&rsquo;ll bring you a cup of tea and some toast myself. You
      don&rsquo;t feel hungry, of course. Ah, no, I thought not. Just a slice of
      dry toast&mdash;yes, yes. I have been there. Some eau de Cologne on your
      forehead, dear? There, there, don&rsquo;t cry, Elma. You&rsquo;ll be
      better by-and-by. Stop in bed till lunch-time. I won&rsquo;t let Lucy come
      up with the tea, of course. You&rsquo;d rather be alone. You were tired
      last night. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my darling. It&rsquo;ll soon pass off.
      There&rsquo;s nothing on earth, nothing at all to be alarmed at.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand nervously on Elma&rsquo;s arm. Half dead with shame as
      she was, Elma noticed it trembled. She noticed, too, that mamma seemed
      almost afraid to catch her eye. When their glance met for an instant the
      mother&rsquo;s eyelids fell, and her cheek, too, burned bright red, almost
      as red, Elma felt, as her own that nestled hot so deep in the pillow.
      Neither said a word to the other of what she thought or felt. But their
      mute sympathy itself made them more shame-faced than ever. In some dim,
      indefinite, instinctive fashion, Elma knew her mother was vaguely aware
      what she had done last night. Her gaze fell half unconsciously on the
      bottom drawer. With quick insight, Mrs. Clifford&rsquo;s eye followed her
      daughter&rsquo;s. Then it fell as before. Elma looked up at her terrified,
      and burst into a sudden flood of tears. Her mother stooped down and caught
      her wildly in her arms. &ldquo;Cry, cry, my darling,&rdquo; ahe murmured,
      clasping her hard to her breast. &ldquo;Cry, cry; it&rsquo;ll do you good;
      there&rsquo;s safety in crying. Nobody but I shall come near you to-day.
      Nobody else shall know! Don&rsquo;t be afraid of me! Have not I been
      there, too? It&rsquo;s nothing, nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a burst of despair, Elma laid her face in her mother&rsquo;s bosom.
      Some minutes later, Mrs. Clifford went down to meet her husband in the
      breakfast-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; the father asked, shortly, looking hard at his wife&rsquo;s
      face, which told its own tale at once, for it was white and pallid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford answered, with a pre-occupied air.
      &ldquo;Elma&rsquo;s not herself this morning at all. Had a nervous turn
      after she went to her room last night. I know what it is. I suffered from
      them myself when I was about her age.&rdquo; Her eyes fell quickly and she
      shrank from her husband&rsquo;s searching glance. She was a plump-faced
      and well-favoured British matron now, but once, many years before, as a
      slim young girl, she had been in love with somebody&mdash;somebody whom by
      superior parental wisdom she was never allowed to marry, being put off
      instead with a well-connected match, young Mr. Clifford of the Colonial
      Office. That was all. No more romance than that. The common romance of
      every woman&rsquo;s heart. A forgotten love. Yet she tingled to remember
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think?&rdquo; Mr. Clifford asked, laying down his newspaper
      and looking very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think. I know,&rdquo; his wife answered hastily.
      &ldquo;I was wrong the other day, and Elma&rsquo;s in love with that young
      man, Cyril Waring. I know more than that, Reginald; I know you may crush
      her; I know you may kill her; but if you don&rsquo;t want to do that, I
      know she must marry him. Whether we wish it, or whether we don&rsquo;t,
      there&rsquo;s nothing else to be done. As things stand now, it&rsquo;s
      inevitable, unavoidable. She&rsquo;ll never be happy with anybody else&mdash;she
      must have HIM&mdash;and I, for one, won&rsquo;t try to prevent her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reginald Clifford, C.M.G., sometime Administrator of the island of St.
      Kitts, gazed at his wife in blank astonishment. She spoke decidedly; he
      had never heard her speak with such firmness in his life before. It fairly
      took his breath away. He gazed at his wife blankly as he repeated to
      himself in very slow and solemn tones, each word distinct, &ldquo;You, for
      one, won&rsquo;t try to prevent her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford retorted defiantly, assured
      in her own mind she was acting right. &ldquo;Elma&rsquo;s really in love
      with him; and I won&rsquo;t let Elma&rsquo;s life be wrecked&mdash;as some
      lives have been wrecked, and as some mothers would wreck it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford leaned back in his chair, one mass of astonishment, and let
      the Japanese paper-knife he was holding in his right hand drop clattering
      from his fingers. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t heard you say it yourself,
      Louisa,&rdquo; he answered, with a gasp, &ldquo;I could never have
      believed it. I could&mdash;never&mdash;have&mdash;believed it. I don&rsquo;t
      believe it even now. It&rsquo;s impossible, incredible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford repeated. &ldquo;Elma
      must marry the man she&rsquo;s in love with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile poor Elma lay alone in her bedroom upstairs, that awful sense of
      remorse and shame still making her cheeks tingle with unspeakable horror.
      Mrs. Clifford brought up her cup of tea herself. Elma took it with
      gratitude, but still never dared to look her mother in the face. Mrs.
      Clifford, too, kept her own eyes averted. It made Elma&rsquo;s
      self-abasement even profounder than before to feel that her mother
      instinctively knew everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor child lay there long, with a burning face and tingling ears, too
      ashamed to get up and dress herself and face the outer world, too ashamed
      to go down before her father&rsquo;s eyes, till long after lunchtime. Then
      there came a noise at the door once more; the rustling of a dress; a
      retreating footstep. Somebody pushed an envelope stealthily under the
      door. Elma picked it up and examined it curiously. It bore a penny stamp,
      and the local postmark. It must have come then by the two o&rsquo;clock
      delivery, without a doubt; but the address, why, the address was written
      in some unknown hand, and in printing capitals. Elma tore it open with a
      beating heart, and read the one line of manuscript it contained, which was
      also written in the same print-like letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; the letter said, &ldquo;It will do
      you no harm. Resist it when it comes. If you do, you will get the better
      of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma looked at the letter over and over again in a fever of dismay. She
      was certain it was her mother had written that note. But she read it with
      tears, only half-reassured&mdash;and then burnt it to ashes, and proceeded
      to dress herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she went down to the drawing-room, Mrs. Clifford rose from her seat,
      and took her hand in her own, and kissed her on one cheek as if nothing
      out of the common had happened in any way. The talk between them was
      obtrusively commonplace. But all that day long, Elma noticed her mother
      was far tenderer to her than usual; and when she went up to bed Mrs.
      Clifford held her fingers for a moment with a gentle pressure, and kissed
      her twice upon her eyes, and stifled a sigh, and then broke from the room
      as if afraid to speak to her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. &mdash; COLONEL KELMSCOTT&rsquo;S REPENTANCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elma Clifford wasn&rsquo;t the only person who passed a terrible night and
      suffered a painful awakening on the morning after the Holkers&rsquo;
      garden-party. Colonel Kelmscott, too, had his bad half-hour or so before
      he finally fell asleep; and he woke up next day to a sense of shame and
      remorse far more definite, and, therefore, more poignant and more real
      than Elma&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hour after hour, indeed, he lay there on his bed, afraid to toss or turn
      lest he should wake Lady Emily, but with his limbs all fevered and his
      throat all parched, thinking over the strange chance that had thus brought
      him face to face, on the threshold of his honoured age, with the two lads
      he had wronged so long and so cruelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock of meeting them had been a sudden and a painful one. To be sure,
      the Colonel had always felt the time might come when his two eldest sons
      would cross his path in the intricate maze of London society. He had
      steeled himself, as he thought, to meet them there with dignity and with
      stoical reserve. He had made up his mind that if ever the names he had
      imposed upon them were to fall upon his startled ears, no human being that
      stood by and looked on should note for one second a single tremor of his
      lips, a faint shudder of surprise, an almost imperceptible flush or pallor
      on his impassive countenance. And when the shock came, indeed, he had
      borne it, as he meant to bear it, with military calmness. Not even Mrs.
      Clifford, he thought, could have discovered from any undertone of his
      voice or manner that the two lads he received with such well-bred
      unconcern were his own twin sons, the true heirs and inheritors of the
      Tilgate Park property.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, the actual crisis had taken him quite by surprise, and shaken him
      far more than he could ever have conceived possible. For one thing, though
      he quite expected that some day he would run up unawares against Guy and
      Cyril, he did NOT expect it would be down in the country, and still less
      within a few miles&rsquo; drive of Tilgate. In London, of course, all
      things are possible. Sooner or later, there, everybody hustles and clashes
      against everybody. For that reason, he had tried to suggest, by indirect
      means, when he launched them on the world, that the twins should tempt
      their fortune in India or the colonies. He would have liked to think they
      were well out of his way, and out of Granville&rsquo;s, too. But, against
      his advice, they had stayed on in England. So he expected to meet them
      some day, at the Academy private view, perhaps, or in Mrs. Bouverie Barton&rsquo;s
      literary saloon, but certainly NOT on the close sward of the Holkers&rsquo;
      lawn, within a few short miles of his own home at Tilgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he had met them, his conscience, that had lain asleep so long,
      woke up of a sudden with a terrible start, and began to prick him
      fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only they had been ugly, misshapen, vulgar; if only they had spoken
      with coarse, rough voices, or irritated him by their inferior social tone,
      or shown themselves unworthy to be the heirs of Tilgate&mdash;why then,
      the Colonel might possibly have forgiven himself! But to see his own two
      sons, the sons he had never set eyes on for twenty-five years or more,
      grown up into such handsome, well-set, noble-looking fellows&mdash;so
      clever, so bright, so able, so charming&mdash;to feel they were in every
      way as much gentlemen born as Granville himself, and to know he had done
      all three an irreparable wrong, oh, THAT was too much for him. For he had
      kept two of his sons out of their own all these years, only in order to
      make the position and prospects of the third, at last, certainly doubtful,
      and perhaps wretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much to excuse him to himself, no doubt, he cried to his own
      soul piteously in the night watches. Proud man as he was, he could not so
      wholly abase himself even to his inmost self as to admit he had sinned
      without deep provocation. He thought it all over in his heart, just there,
      exactly as it all happened, that simple and natural tale of a common
      wrong, that terrible secret of a lifetime that he was still to repent in
      sackcloth and ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so long before&mdash;all those twenty-six years, or was it
      twenty-eight?&mdash;since his regiment had been quartered away down in
      Devonshire. He was a handsome subaltern then, with a frank open face&mdash;Harry
      Kelmscott, of the Greys&mdash;just such another man, he said to himself in
      his remorse, as his son Granville now&mdash;or rather, perhaps, as Guy and
      Cyril Waring. For he couldn&rsquo;t conceal from himself any longer the
      patent fact that Lucy Waring&rsquo;s sons were like his own old self, and
      sturdier, handsomer young fellows into the bargain than Lady Emily
      Kelmscott&rsquo;s boy Granville, whom he had made into the heir of the
      Tilgate manors. The moor, where the Greys were quartered that summer, was
      as dull as ditch-water. No society, no dances, no hunting, no sport; what
      wonder a man of his tastes, spoiling for want of a drawing-room to
      conquer, should have kept his hand in with pretty Lucy Waring?
    </p>
    <p>
      But he married her&mdash;he married her. He did her no wrong in the end.
      He hadn&rsquo;t that sin at least to lay to his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, well, poor Lucy! he had really been fond of her; as fond as a
      Kelmscott of Tilgate could reasonably be expected ever to prove towards
      the daughter of a simple Dartmoor farmer. It began in flirtation, of
      course, as such things will begin; and it ended, as they will end, too, in
      love, at least on poor Lucy&rsquo;s side, for what can you expect from a
      Kelmscott of Tilgate? And, indeed, indeed, he said to himself earnestly,
      he meant her no harm, though he seemed at times to be cruel to her. As
      soon as he gathered how deeply she was entangled&mdash;how seriously she
      took it all&mdash;how much she was in love with him&mdash;he tried hard to
      break it off, he tried hard to put matters to her in their proper light;
      he tried to show her that an officer and a gentleman, a Kelmscott of
      Tilgate, could never really have dreamed of marrying the half-educated,
      half-peasant daughter of a Devonshire farmer. Though, to be sure, she was
      a lady in her way, too, poor Lucy; as much of a lady in manner and in
      heart as Emily herself, whose father was an earl, and whose mother was a
      marquis&rsquo;s eldest daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much a lady in her way, in deed, in thought, and all that&mdash;one of
      nature&rsquo;s gentlewomen&mdash;that when Lucy cried and broke her heart
      at his halting explanations, he was unmanned by her sobs, and did a thing
      no Kelmscott of Tilgate should ever have stooped to do&mdash;yes, promised
      to marry her. Of course, he didn&rsquo;t attempt in his own heart to
      justify that initial folly, as lie thought it, to himself. He didn&rsquo;t
      pretend to condone it. He only allowed he had acted like a fool. A
      Kelmscott of Tilgate should have drawn back long before, or else, having
      gone so far, should have told the girl plainly&mdash;at whatever cost, to
      her&mdash;he could go no further and have no more to say to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, that would have killed the poor thing outright. But a
      Kelmscott, you know, should respect his order, and shouldn&rsquo;t shrink
      for a moment from these trifling sacrifices!
    </p>
    <p>
      However, his own heart was better, in those days, than his class
      philosophy. He couldn&rsquo;t trample on poor Lucy Waring. So he made a
      fool of himself in the end&mdash;and married Lucy. Ah, well! ah, well!
      every man makes a fool of himself once or twice in his life; and though
      the Colonel was ashamed now of having so far bemeaned his order as to
      marry the girl, why, if the truth must out, he would have been more
      ashamed still, in his heart of hearts, even then, if he hadn&rsquo;t
      married her. He was better than his creed. He could never have crushed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Married her, yes; but not publicly, of course. At least, he respected
      public decency. He married her under his own name, to be sure, but by
      special licence, and at a remote little village on the far side of the
      moor, where nobody knew either himself or Lucy. In those days, he hadn&rsquo;t
      yet come into possession of the Tilgate estates; and if his father had
      known of it&mdash;well, the Admiral was such a despotic old man that he&rsquo;d
      have insisted on his son&rsquo;s selling out at once, and going off to
      Australia or heaven knows where, on a journey round the world, and
      breaking poor Lucy&rsquo;s heart by his absence. Partly for her sake, the
      Colonel said to himself now in the silent night, and partly for his own,
      he had concealed the marriage&mdash;for the time being&mdash;from the
      Admiral.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came that horrible embroilment&mdash;oh, how well he remembered
      it. Ah me, ah me, it seemed but yesterday&mdash;when his father insisted
      he was to marry Lady Emily Croke, Lord Aldeburgh&rsquo;s daughter; and he
      dared not marry her, of course, having a wife already, and he dared not
      tell his father, on the other hand, why he couldn&rsquo;t marry her. It
      was a hateful time. He shrank from recalling it. He was keeping Lucy, then
      his own wedded wife, as Mrs. Waring, in small rooms in Plymouth; and yet
      he was running up to town now and again, on leave, as the gay young
      bachelor, the heir of Tilgate Park&mdash;and meeting Emily Croke at every
      party he went to in London&mdash;and braving the Admiral&rsquo;s wrath by
      refusing to propose to her. What he would ever have done if Lucy had
      lived, he couldn&rsquo;t imagine. But, there! Lucy DIDN&rsquo;T live; so
      he was saved that bother. Poor child, it brought tears to his eyes even
      now to think of her. He brushed them furtively away, lest he should waken
      Lady Emily.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it was a shock to him, the night Lucy died. Just then, he could
      hardly realize how lucky was the accident. He sat there by her side, the
      day the twins were born, to see her safely through her trouble; for he had
      always done his duty, after a fashion, by Lucy. When a girl of that class
      marries a gentleman, don&rsquo;t you see, and consents, too, mind you, to
      marry him privately, she can&rsquo;t expect to share much of her husband&rsquo;s
      company. She can&rsquo;t expect he should stultify himself by
      acknowledging her publicly before his own class. And, indeed, he always
      meant to acknowledge her in the end&mdash;after his father&rsquo;s death,
      when there was no fear of the Admiral&rsquo;s cutting off his allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how curiously events often turn out of themselves. The twins were born
      on a Friday morning, and by the Saturday night, poor Lucy was lying dead,
      a pale, sweet corpse, in her own little room, near the Hoe, at Plymouth.
      It was a happy release for him though he really loved her. But still, when
      a man&rsquo;s fool enough to love a girl below his own station in life&mdash;the
      Colonel paused and broke off. It was twenty-seven years ago now, yet he
      really loved her. He couldn&rsquo;t find it in his heart even then to
      indorse to the full the common philosophy of his own order.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there he was left with the two boys on his hands, but free, if he
      liked, to marry Lady Emily. No reason on earth, of course, why he shouldn&rsquo;t
      marry her now. So, naturally, he married her&mdash;after a fortnight&rsquo;s
      interval. The Admiral was all smiles and paternal blessings at this sudden
      change of front on his son&rsquo;s part. Why the dickens Harry hadn&rsquo;t
      wanted to marry the girl before, to be sure he couldn&rsquo;t conceive;
      hankering after some missy in the country, he supposed, that silly rot
      about what they call love, no doubt; but now that Harry had come to his
      senses at last, and taken the Earl&rsquo;s lass, why, the Admiral was
      indulgence and munificence itself; the young people should have an ample
      allowance, and my daughter-in-law, Lady Emily, should live on the best
      that Tilgate and Chetwood could possibly afford her.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would you have? the Colonel asked piteously, in the dead of night, of
      his own conscience. How else could he have acted? He said nothing. That
      was all, mind you, he declared to himself more than once in his own soul.
      He told no lies. He made no complications. While the Admiral lived, he
      brought up Lucy&rsquo;s sons, quite privately, at Plymouth. And as soon as
      ever the Admiral died, he really and truly meant to acknowledge them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But fathers never die&mdash;in entailed estates. The Admiral lived so long&mdash;quite,
      quite too long for Guy and Cyril. Granville was born, and grew to be a big
      boy, and was treated by everybody as the heir to Tilgate. And now the
      Colonel&rsquo;s difficulties gathered thicker around him. At last, in the
      fulness of time, the Admiral died, and slept with his fathers, whose
      Elizabethan ruff&rsquo;s were the honour and glory of the chancel at
      Tilgate; and then the day of reckoning was fairly upon him. How well he
      remembered that awful hour. He couldn&rsquo;t, he couldn&rsquo;t. He knew
      it was his duty to acknowledge his rightful sons and heirs, but he hadn&rsquo;t
      the courage. Things had all altered so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Guy and Cyril had gone to Charterhouse as nobody&rsquo;s wards,
      and been brought up in the expectation of earning their own livelihood, so
      no wrong, he said casuistically, had been done to THEM, at any rate. And
      Granville had been brought up as the heir of Tilgate. Lady Emily naturally
      expected her son to succeed his father. He had gone too far to turn back
      at last. And yet&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, in his own heart, disguise it as he might, he knew he was keeping
      his lawful sons out of their own in the end, and it was his duty to
      acknowledge them as the heirs of Tilgate.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. &mdash; A FAMILY JAR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hour after hour the unhappy man lay still as death on his bed and reasoned
      in vain with his accusing conscience. To be sure, he said to himself, no
      man was bound by the law of England to name his heir. It is for the eldest
      son himself to come forward and make his claim. If Guy and Cyril could
      prove their title to the Tilgate estates when he himself was dead, that
      was their private business. He wasn&rsquo;t bound to do anything special
      to make the way easy for them beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still, when he saw them, his heart arose and smote him. His very class
      prejudices fought hard on their behalf. These men were gentlemen, the
      eldest sons of a Kelmscott of Tilgate&mdash;true Kelmscotts to the core&mdash;handsome,
      courtly, erect of bearing. Guy was the very image of the Kelmscott of
      Tilgate Park who bled for King Charles at Marston Moor; Cyril had the
      exact mien of Sir Rupert Kelmscott, Knight of Chetwood, the ablest of
      their race, whose portrait, by Kneller, hung in the great hall between his
      father; the Admiral, and his uncle, Sir Frederick. They had all the
      qualities the Colonel himself associated with the Kelmscott name. They
      were strong, brave, vigorous, able to hold their own against all comers.
      To leave them out in the cold was not only wrong&mdash;it was also, he
      felt in his heart of hearts, a treason to his order.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after long watching, he fell asleep. But he slept uneasily. When
      he woke, it was with a start. He found himself murmuring to himself in his
      troubled sleep, &ldquo;Break the entail, and settle a sum on the two that
      will quiet them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the only way left to prevent public scandal, and to save Lady Emily
      and his son Granville from a painful disclosure: while, at the same time,
      it would to some extent satisfy the claims of his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compromise, compromise; there&rsquo;s nothing like compromise. Colonel
      Kelmscott had always had by temperament a truly British love of
      compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
      To carry out his plan, indeed, it would be necessary to break the entail
      twice; once formally, and once again really. He must begin by getting
      Granville&rsquo;s consent to the proposed arrangement, so as to raise
      ready money with which to bribe the young men; and as soon as Granville&rsquo;s
      consent was obtained, he must put it plainly to Guy and Cyril, as an
      anonymous benefactor, that if they would consent to accept a fixed sum in
      lieu of all contingencies, then the secret of their birth would be
      revealed to them at last, and they would be asked to break the entail on
      the estates as eldest sons of a gentleman of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hard bargain; a very hard bargain; but then these boys would jump
      at it, no doubt; expecting nothing as they did, they&rsquo;d certainly
      jump at it. It&rsquo;s a great point, you see, to come in suddenly, when
      you expect nothing, to a nice lump sum of five or six thousand!
    </p>
    <p>
      So much so, indeed, that the real difficulty, he thought, would rather lie
      in approaching Granville.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast that morning, however, he tapped his son on the shoulder
      as he was leaving the table, and said to him, in his distinctly business
      tone, &ldquo;Granville, will you step with me into the library for ten
      minutes&rsquo; talk? There&rsquo;s a small matter of the estate I desire
      to discuss with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville looked back at him with a curiously amused air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very odd
      coincidence. But do you know, I was going this morning myself to ask for a
      chance of ten minutes&rsquo; talk with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and followed his father into the oak-panelled library. The
      Colonel sat down on one of the uncomfortable library chairs, especially
      designed, with their knobs and excrescences, to prevent the bare
      possibility of serious study. Granville took a seat opposite him, across
      the formal oak table. Colonel Kelmscott paused; and cleared his throat
      nervously. Then, with military promptitude, he darted straight into the
      very thick of the fray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granville,&rdquo; he said abruptly, &ldquo;I want to speak with you
      about a rather big affair. The fact of it is, I&rsquo;m going to break the
      entail. I want to raise some money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The son gave a little start of surprise and amusement. &ldquo;Why, this is
      very odd,&rdquo; he exclaimed once more, in an astonished tone. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      just the precise thing I wanted to talk about with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Kelmscott eyed him with an answering start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not debts!&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;My boy, my boy, this is
      bad. Not debts surely, Granville; I never suspected it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear no,&rdquo; Granville answered frankly. &ldquo;No debts,
      you may be sure. But I wanted to feel myself on a satisfactory basis&mdash;as
      to income and so forth: and I was prepared to pay for my freedom well. To
      tell you the truth outright, I want to marry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Kelmscott eyed him close with a very puzzled look. &ldquo;Not Elma
      Clifford, my boy,&rdquo; he said again quickly. &ldquo;For of course, if
      it is her, Granville, I need hardly say&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man cut him short with a hasty little laugh. &ldquo;Elma
      Clifford,&rdquo; he repeated, with some scorn in his musical voice,
      &ldquo;Oh, dear no, not HER. If it had been her you may be sure there&rsquo;d
      be no reason of any sort for breaking the entail. But the fact is this: I
      dislike allowances one way or the other. I want to feel once for all I&rsquo;m
      my own master. I want to marry&mdash;not this girl or that, but whom ever
      I will. I don&rsquo;t care to come to you with my hat in my hand, asking
      how much you&rsquo;ll be kind enough to allow me if I venture to take Miss
      So-and-so or Miss What-you-may-call-it. And as I know you want money
      yourself for this new wing you&rsquo;re thinking of, why, I&rsquo;m
      prepared to break the entail at once, and sell whatever building land you
      think right and proper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The father held his breath. What on earth could this mean? &ldquo;And who
      is the girl, Granville?&rdquo; he asked, with unconcealed interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t care to hear,&rdquo; his son answered carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Kelmscott looked across at him with a very red face. &ldquo;Not
      some girl who&rsquo;ll bring disgrace upon your mother, I hope?&rdquo; he
      said, with a half-pang of remorse, remembering Lucy. &ldquo;Not some young
      woman beneath your own station in life. For to that, you may be sure, I&rsquo;ll
      never consent under any circumstances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville drew himself up proudly, with a haughty smile. He was a
      Kelmscott, too, as arrogant as the best of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not the difficulty,&rdquo; he answered, looking
      rather amused than annoyed or frightened. &ldquo;My tastes are NOT low. I
      hope I know better than to disgrace my family. The lady I want to marry,
      and for whose sake I wish you to make some arrangement beforehand is&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      be surprised&mdash;well, Gwendoline Gildersleeve.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gwendoline Gildersleeve,&rdquo; his father echoed, astonished; for
      there was feud between the families, &ldquo;That rascally, land-grabbing
      barrister&rsquo;s daughter! Why, how on earth do you come to know anything
      of her, Granville? Nobody in Surrey ever had the impertinence yet to ask
      me or mine to meet the Gildersleeves anywhere, since that disgraceful
      behaviour of his about the boundary fences. And I didn&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d
      ever even seen her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody in Surrey ever did ask me to meet her,&rdquo; Granville
      answered somewhat curtly. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t expect every one in
      London society to keep watch over the quarrels of every country parish in
      provincial England! It wouldn&rsquo;t be reasonable. I met Gwendoline, if
      you want to know, at the Bertrams&rsquo;, in Berkeley Square, and she and
      I got on so well together that we&rsquo;ve&mdash;well, we&rsquo;ve met
      from time to time in the Park, since our return from town, and we think by
      this time we may consider ourselves informally engaged to one another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Kelmscott gazed at his son in a perfect access of indignant
      amazement. Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s daughter! That rascally Q.C.&lsquo;s!
      At any other moment such a proposal would have driven him forthwith into
      open hostilities. If Granville chose to marry a girl like that, why,
      Granville might have lived on what his father would allow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just now, however, with this keen fit of remorse quite fresh upon his soul
      about poor Lucy&rsquo;s sons, Colonel Kelmscott was almost disposed to
      accept the opening thus laid before him by Granville&rsquo;s proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he temporized for awhile, nursing his chin with his hand, and then,
      after much discussion, yielded at last a conditional consent&mdash;conditional
      upon their mutual agreement as to the terms on which the entail was to be
      finally broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what sort of arrangement do you propose I should make for your
      personal maintenance, and this Gildersleeve girl&rsquo;s household?&rdquo;
      the Colonel asked at length, with a very red face, descending to details.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son, without appearing to notice the implied slight to Gwendoline,
      named the terms that he thought would satisfy him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very stiff sum,&rdquo; the master of Tilgate
      retorted; &ldquo;but perhaps I could manage it; per&mdash;haps I could
      manage it. We must sell the Dowlands farm at once, that&rsquo;s certain,
      and I must take the twelve thousand or so the land will fetch for my own
      use, absolutely and without restriction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To build the new wing with?&rdquo; the son put in, with a gesture
      of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To build the new wing with? Why, certainly not,&rdquo; his father
      answered angrily. &ldquo;Am I to bargain with my son what use I&rsquo;m to
      make of my own property? Mark my words, I won&rsquo;t submit to
      interference. To do precisely as I choose with, sir. To roll in if I like!
      To fling into the sea, if the fancy takes me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville Kelmscott stared hard at him. Twelve thousand pounds! What on
      earth could his father mean by this whim? he wondered. &ldquo;Twelve
      thousand pounds is a very big sum to fling away from the estate without a
      question asked,&rdquo; he retorted, growing hot &ldquo;It seems to me, you
      too closely resemble our ancestors who came over from Holland. In matters
      of business, you know, the fault of the Dutch is giving too little and
      asking too much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His father glared at him. That&rsquo;s the worst of this huckstering and
      higgling with your own flesh and blood. You have to put up with such
      intolerable insults. But he controlled himself, and continued. The longer
      he talked, however, the hotter and angrier he became by degrees. And what
      made him the hottest and angriest of all was the knowledge meanwhile that
      he was doing it every bit for Granville&rsquo;s own sake; nay, more, that
      consideration for Granville alone had brought him originally into this
      peck of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he could contain himself with indignation no longer. His temper
      broke down. He flared up and out with it. &ldquo;Take care what you do!&rdquo;
      he cried. &ldquo;Take care what you say, Granville! I&rsquo;m not going to
      be bearded with impunity in my den. If you press me too hard, remember, I&rsquo;ll
      ruin all. I can cut you off with a shilling, sir, if I choose&mdash;cut
      you off with a shilling. Yes, and do justice to others I&rsquo;ve wronged
      for your sake. Don&rsquo;t provoke me too far, I say, If you do, you&rsquo;ll
      repent it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut me off with a shilling, sir!&rdquo; his son answered angrily,
      rising and staring hard at him. &ldquo;Why, what do you mean by that? You
      know you can&rsquo;t do it, My interest in the estate&rsquo;s as good as
      your own. I&rsquo;m the eldest son&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off suddenly; for at those fatal words, Colonel Kelmscott&rsquo;s
      face, fiery red till then, grew instantly blanched and white with terror.
      &ldquo;Oh, what have I done?&rdquo; the unhappy man cried, seeing his son&rsquo;s
      eyes read some glimpse of the truth too clearly in his look. &ldquo;Oh,
      what have I said? Forget it, Granny, forget it! I didn&rsquo;t mean to go
      so far as I did in my anger. I was a fool&mdash;a fool! I gave way too
      much. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, my boy, forget it, forget it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man looked across at him with a dazed and puzzled look, yet very
      full of meaning. &ldquo;I shall never forget it,&rdquo; he said slowly.
      &ldquo;I shall learn what it means. I don&rsquo;t know how things stand;
      but I see you meant it. Do as you like about the entail. It&rsquo;s no
      business of mine. Take your pound of flesh, your twelve thousand down, and
      pay your hush-money! I don&rsquo;t know whom you bribe, and I have nothing
      to say to it. I never dragged the honour of the Kelmscotts in the dust. I
      won&rsquo;t drag it now. I wash my hands clean from it. I ask no
      questions. I demand no explanations. I only say this. Until I know what
      you mean&mdash;know whether I&rsquo;m lawful heir to Tilgate Park or not,
      I won&rsquo;t marry the girl I meant to marry. I have too much regard for
      her, and for the honour of our house, to take her on what may prove to be
      false expectations. Break the entail, I say! Raise your twelve thousand.
      Pay off your bloodhounds. But never expect me to touch a penny of your
      money, henceforth and for ever, till I know whether it was yours and mine
      at all to deal with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Kelmscott bent down his proud head meekly. &ldquo;As you will,
      Granville,&rdquo; he answered, quite broken with remorse, and silenced by
      shame. &ldquo;My boy, my boy, I only wanted to save you!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. &mdash; IN SILENCE AND TEARS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When he had time to think, Colonel Kelmscott determined in his own mind
      that he would still do his best to save Granville, whether Granville
      himself wished it or otherwise. So he proceeded to take all the necessary
      steps for breaking the entail and raising the money he needed for Guy and
      Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all this, Granville neither acquiesced nor dissented. He signed
      mechanically whatever documents his father presented to him, and he stood
      by his bargain with a certain sullen, undeviating, hard-featured loyalty;
      but he never forgot those few angry words in which his father had half let
      out his long-guarded life secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking the matter over continually with himself, however, he came in the
      end to the natural conclusion that one explanation alone would fit all the
      facts. He was not his father&rsquo;s eldest son at all. Colonel Kelmscott
      must have been married to some one else before his marriage with Lady
      Emily. That some one else&rsquo;s son was the real heir of Tilgate. And it
      was to him that his father, in his passionate penitence, proposed, after
      many years, to do one-sided justice. Now Granville Kelmscott, though a
      haughty and somewhat head-strong fellow, after the fashion of his race,
      was a young man of principle and of honour. The moment this hideous doubt
      occurred to his mind, he couldn&rsquo;t rest in his bed till he had
      cleared it all up and settled it for ever, one way or the other. If
      Tilgate wasn&rsquo;t his, by law and right, he wanted none of it. If his
      father was trying to buy off the real heir to the estate with a pitiful
      pittance, in order to preserve the ill-gotten remainder for Lady Emily&rsquo;s
      son, why, Granville for his part would be no active party to such a
      miserable compromise. If some other man was the Colonel&rsquo;s lawful
      heir, let that other man take the property and enjoy it; but he, Granville
      Kelmscott, would go forth upon the world, an honest adventurer, to seek
      his fortune with his own right hand wherever he might find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, he could take no active step, on the other hand, to hunt up the
      truth about the Colonel&rsquo;s real or supposed first marriage. For here
      an awful dilemma blocked the way before him. If the Colonel had married
      before, and if by that former marriage he had a son or sons&mdash;how
      could Granville be sure the supposed first wife was dead before the second
      was married? And supposing, for a moment, she was not dead&mdash;supposing
      his father had been even more criminal and more unjust than he at first
      imagined&mdash;how could he take the initiative himself in showing that
      his own mother, Lady Emily Kelmscott, was no wife at all in the sight of
      the law? that some other woman was his father&rsquo;s lawful consort? The
      bare possibility of such an issue was too horrible for any son on earth to
      face undismayed. So, tortured and distracted by his divided duty,
      Granville Kelmscott shrank alike from action or inaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of such doubts and difficulties, however, one duty shone out
      clear as day before him. Till the mystery was cleared up, till the problem
      was solved, he must see no more of Gwendoline Gildersleeve. He had engaged
      himself to her as the heir of Tilgate. She had accepted him under that
      guise, and looked forward to an early and happy marriage. Now, all was
      changed. He was, or might be, a beggar and an outcast. To be sure, he knew
      Gwendoline loved him for himself; but how could he marry her if he didn&rsquo;t
      even know he had anything of his own in the world to marry upon? The park
      and fallow deer had been a part of himself; without them, he felt he was
      hardly even a Kelmscott. It was his plain duty, now, for Gwendoline&rsquo;s
      sake, to release her from her promise to a man who might perhaps be
      penniless, and who couldn&rsquo;t even feel sure he was the lawful son of
      his own father. And yet&mdash;for Lady Emily&rsquo;s sake&mdash;he mustn&rsquo;t
      hint, even to Gwendoline, the real reason which moved him to offer her
      this release. He must throw himself upon her mercy, without cause
      assigned, and ask her for the time being to have faith in him and to
      believe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, a day or two after the interview with his father in the library, the
      self-disinherited heir of Tilgate took the path through the glade that led
      into the dell beyond the boundary fence&mdash;that dell which had once
      been accounted a component part of Tilgate Park, but which Gilbert
      Gildersleeve had proved, in his cold-blooded documentary legal way, to
      belong in reality to the grounds of Woodlands. It was in the dell that
      Granville sometimes ran up against Gwendoline. He sat down on the broken
      ledge of ironstone that overhung the little brook. It was eleven o&rsquo;clock
      gone. By eleven o&rsquo;clock, three mornings in the week, chance&mdash;pure
      chance&mdash;the patron god of lovers, brought Gwendoline into the dell to
      meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, a light footfall rang soft upon the path, and next moment a
      tall and beautiful girl, with a wealth of auburn hair, and a bright colour
      in her cheeks, tripped lightly down the slope, as if strolling through the
      wood in maiden meditation, fancy free, unexpecting any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you here, Mr. Kelmscott?&rdquo; she exclaimed, as she saw
      him, her pink cheek deepening as she spoke to a still profounder crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here, Gwendoline,&rdquo; Granville Kelmscott
      answered, with a smile of recognition at her maidenly pretence of an
      undesigned coincidence. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m here, to say the truth,
      because I quite expected this morning to meet you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand gravely. Gwendoline let her eyes fall modestly on the
      ground, as if some warmer greeting were more often bestowed between them.
      The young man blushed with a certain manly shame. &ldquo;No, not to-day,
      dear,&rdquo; he said, with an effort, as she held her cheek aside, half
      courting and half deprecating the expected kiss. &ldquo;Oh, Gwendoline, I
      don&rsquo;t know how to begin. I don&rsquo;t know how to say it. But I&rsquo;ve
      got very sad news for you&mdash;news that I can&rsquo;t bear to break&mdash;that
      I can&rsquo;t venture to explain&mdash;that I don&rsquo;t even properly
      understand myself. I must throw myself upon your faith. I must just ask
      you to trust me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendoline let him seat her, unresisting, upon the ledge by his side, and
      her cheek grew suddenly ashy pale, as she answered with a gasp, forgetting
      the &ldquo;Mr. Kelmscott&rdquo; at this sudden leap into the stern
      realities of life, &ldquo;Why, Granville, what do you mean? You know I can
      trust you. You know, whatever it may be, I believe you implicitly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man took her hand in his with a tender pressure. It was a
      terrible message to have to deliver. He bungled and blundered on, with
      many twists and turns, through some inarticulate attempt at an indefinite
      explanation. It wasn&rsquo;t that he didn&rsquo;t love her&mdash;oh,
      devotedly, eternally, she must know that well; she never could doubt it.
      It wasn&rsquo;t that any shadow had arisen between him and her, it wasn&rsquo;t
      anything he could speak about, or anything she must say to any soul on
      earth&mdash;oh, for his mother&rsquo;s sake, he hoped and trusted she
      would religiously keep his secret inviolate! But something had happened to
      him within the last few days&mdash;something unspeakable, indefinite,
      uncertain, vague, yet very full of the most dreadful possibilities;
      something that might make him unable to support a wife; something that at
      least must delay or postpone for an unknown time the long-hoped-for
      prospect of his claiming her and marrying her. Some day, perhaps&mdash;he
      broke off suddenly, and looked with a wistful look into her deep grey
      eyes. His resolution failed him. &ldquo;One kiss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Gwendoline!&rdquo;
      His voice was choking. The beautiful girl, turning towards him with a wild
      sob, fell, yielding herself on his breast, and cried hot tears of joy at
      that evident sign that, in spite of all he said, he still really loved
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat there long, hand in hand, and eye on eye, talking it all over, as
      lovers will, with infinite delays, yet getting no nearer towards a
      solution either way. Gwendoline, for her part, didn&rsquo;t care, of
      course&mdash;what true woman does?&mdash;whether Granville was the heir of
      Tilgate or not; she would marry him all the more, she said, if he were a
      penniless nobody. All she wanted was to love him and be near him. Let him
      marry her now, marry her to-day, and then go where he would in the world
      to seek his livelihood. But Granville, poor fellow, alarmed at the bare
      suggestion&mdash;for his mother&rsquo;s sake&mdash;that Tilgate might
      really not be his, checked her at once in her outburst with a grave,
      silent look; he was still, he said calmly, the inheritor of Tilgate. It
      wasn&rsquo;t that. At least, not as she took it. He didn&rsquo;t know
      precisely what it was himself. She must have faith in him and trust him.
      She must wait and see. In the end, he hoped, he would come back and marry
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gwendoline made answer, with many tears, that she knew it was so, and
      that she loved him and trusted him. So, after sitting there long, hand
      locked in hand, and heart intent on heart, the two young people rose at
      last to go, protesting and vowing their mutual love on either side, as
      happy and as miserable in their divided lives as two young people in all
      England that moment. Over and over again they kissed and said good-bye;
      then they stood with one another&rsquo;s fingers clasped hard in their
      own, unwilling to part, and unable to loose them. After that, they kissed
      again, and declared once more they were broken-hearted, and could never
      leave one another. But still, Granville added, half aside, he must make up
      his mind not to see Gwendoline again&mdash;honour demanded that sacrifice&mdash;till
      he could come at last a rich man to claim her. Meanwhile, she was free;
      and he&mdash;he was ever hers, devotedly, whole-souledly. But they were no
      longer engaged. He was hers in heart only. Let her try to forget him. He
      could never forget her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gwendoline, sobbing and tearful, but believing him implicitly,
      retreated with slow steps, looking back at each turn of the zigzag path,
      and sending the ghosts of dead kisses from her finger-tips to greet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below in the dell Granville stood still, and watched her depart in
      breathless silence. Then, in an agony of despair, he flung himself down on
      the ground and burst into tears, and sobbed like a child over his broken
      daydream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendoline, coming back to make sure, saw him lying and sobbing so; and,
      woman-like, felt compelled to step down just one minute to comfort him.
      Granville in turn refused her proffered comfort&mdash;it was better so&mdash;he
      mustn&rsquo;t listen to her any more; he must steel himself to say No; he
      must remember it was dishonourable of him to drag a delicately nurtured
      girl into a penniless marriage. Then they kissed once more and made it all
      up again; and they sobbed and wept as before, and broke it off for ever;
      and they said good-bye for the very last time; and they decided they must
      never meet till Granville came back; and they hoped they would sometimes
      catch just a glimpse of one another in the outer world, and whatever the
      other one said or did, they would each in their hearts be always true to
      their first great love; and they were more miserable still, and they were
      happier than they had ever been in their lives before; and they parted at
      last, with a desperate effort, each perfectly sure of the other&rsquo;s
      love, and each vowing in soul they would never, never see one another
      again, but each, for all that, perfectly certain that some day or other
      they would be husband and wife, though Tilgate and the wretched little
      fallow deer should sink, unwept, to the bottom of the ocean.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; BUSINESS FIRST.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The manager at Messrs. Drummond, Coutts and Barclay&rsquo;s, Limited,
      received Colonel Kelmscott with distinguished consideration. A courteous,
      conciliatory sort of man, that manager, with his close-shaven face and his
      spotless shirt-front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five minutes, my dear sir?&rdquo; he exclaimed, with warmth,
      motioning his visitor blandly into the leather-covered chair. &ldquo;Half
      an hour, if you wish it. We always have leisure to receive our clients.
      Any service we can render them, we&rsquo;re only too happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is a very peculiar bit of business,&rdquo; Colonel
      Kelmscott answered, humming and hawing with obvious hesitation. &ldquo;It
      isn&rsquo;t quite in the regular way of banking, I believe. Perhaps,
      indeed, I ought rather to have put it into the hands of my solicitor. But,
      even if you can&rsquo;t manage the thing yourself, you may be able to put
      me in the way of finding out how best I can get it managed elsewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager bowed. His smile was a smile of genuine satisfaction. Colonel
      Kelmscott of Tilgate was in a most gracious humour. The manager, with
      deference, held himself wholly at his client&rsquo;s disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Colonel proceeded to unfold his business. There were two young men,
      now knocking about town, of the names of Guy and Cyril Waring&mdash;the
      one a journalist, the other a painter&mdash;and they had rooms in Staple
      Inn, Holborn, which would doubtless form a sufficient clue by which to
      identify them. Colonel Kelmscott desired unobtrusively to know where these
      young men banked&mdash;if indeed they were in a position to keep an
      account; and when that was found out, he wished Messrs. Drummond, Coutts
      and Barclay, Limited, to place a sum of money at their bankers to their
      credit, without mentioning the name of the person so placing it, as well
      as to transmit to them a sealed envelope, containing instructions as to
      the use to be made of the money in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager nodded a cautious acquiescence. To place the money to the
      credit of the two young men, indeed, would be quite in their way. But to
      send the sealed envelope, without being aware of its contents, or the
      nature of the business on which it was despatched, would be much less
      regular. Perhaps the Colonel might find some other means of managing
      without their aid that portion of the business arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, for his part, fell in readily enough with this modest point
      of view. It amply sufficed for him if the money were paid to the young men&rsquo;s
      credit, and a receipt, forwarded to him in due course, under cover of a
      number, to the care of the bankers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; the manager answered, rubbing his hands
      contentedly. &ldquo;Our confidential clerk will settle all that for you. A
      most sagacious person, our confidential clerk. No eyes, no ears, no tongue
      for anything but our clients&rsquo; interests.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel smiled, and sat a little longer, giving further details as the
      precise amount he wished sent, and the particular way he wished to send it&mdash;the
      whole sum to be, in fact, twelve thousand pounds, amount of the purchase
      money of the Dowlands farms, whereof only six thousand had as yet been
      paid down; and that six thousand he wished to place forthwith to the
      credit of Cyril Waring, the painter. The remaining six thousand, to be
      settled, as agreed, in five weeks&rsquo; time, he would then make over
      under the self-same conditions to the other brother, Guy Waring, the
      journalist. It had gone a trifle too cheap, that land at Dowlands, the
      Colonel opined; but still, in days like these he was very glad, indeed, to
      find a purchaser for the place at anything like its value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think a Miss Ewes was the fortunate bidder, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
      the manager asked, just to make a certain decent show of interest in his
      client&rsquo;s estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Elma Ewes of Kenilworth,&rdquo; the Colonel answered,
      letting loose for a moment his tongue, that unruly member. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
      the composer, you know&mdash;writes songs and dances; remotely connected
      with Reginald Clifford, the man who was Governor of some West Indian
      Dutch-oven&mdash;St. Kitts, I think, or Antigua&mdash;he lives down our
      way, and he&rsquo;s a neighbour of mine at Tilgate. Or rather she&rsquo;s
      connected with Mrs. Clifford, the Governor&rsquo;s wife, who was one of
      the younger branch, a Miss Ewes of Worthing, daughter of the Ewes who was
      Dean of Dorchester. Elma&rsquo;s been a family name for years with all the
      lot of Eweses, good, bad, or indifferent. Came down to them, don&rsquo;t
      you know, from that Roumanian ancestress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; the manager answered, now beginning to be really
      interested&mdash;for the Cliffords were clients too, and it behoves a
      banker to know everything about everybody&rsquo;s business. &ldquo;So Mrs.
      Clifford had an ancestress who was a Roumanian, had she? Well, I&rsquo;ve
      noticed at times her complexion looked very southern and gipsy-like&mdash;distinctly
      un-English.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they call it Roumanian,&rdquo; Colonel Kelmscott went on in a
      confidential tone, roping his white moustache, and growing more and more
      conversational; &ldquo;they call it Roumanian, because it sounds more
      respectable; but I believe, if you go right down to the very bottom of the
      thing, it was much more like some kind of Oriental gipsy. Sir Michael
      Ewes, the founder of the house, in George the Second&rsquo;s time, was
      ambassador for awhile at Constantinople. He began life, indeed, I believe,
      as a Turkey merchant. Well, at Pera one day, so the story goes&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      find it all in Horace Walpole&rsquo;s diary&mdash;he picked up with this
      dark-skinned gipsy-woman, who was a wonderful creature in her way, a sort
      of mesmeric sorceress, who belonged to some tribe of far eastern serpent
      charmers. It seems that women of this particular tribe were regularly
      trained by the men to be capering priestesses&mdash;or fortune-tellers, if
      you like&mdash;who performed some extraordinary sacred antics of a
      mystical kind, much after the fashion of the howling dervishes. However
      that may be, Sir Michael, at any rate, pacing the streets of Pera, saw the
      woman that she was passing fair, and fell in love with her outright at
      some dervish entertainment. But being a very well-behaved old man,
      combining a liking for Orientals with a British taste for the highest
      respectability, he had the girl baptized and made into a proper Christian
      first; and then he married her off-hand and brought her home with him as
      my Lady Ewes to England. She was presented at Court, to George the Second;
      and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu stood her sponsor on the occasion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did it all turn out?&rdquo; the manager asked, with an air
      of intelligent historical interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn out? Well, it turned out in a thumping big family of thirteen
      children,&rdquo; the Colonel answered; &ldquo;most of whom, happily for
      the father, died young, But the five who survived, and who married at last
      into very good connections, all had one peculiarity, which they
      transmitted to all their female descendants. Very odd these hereditary
      traits, to be sure. Very singular! Very singular!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, to be sure,&rdquo; the manager answered, turning over a pile of
      letters. &ldquo;And what was the hereditary trait handed down, as you say,
      in the family of the Roumanian lady?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in the first place,&rdquo; the Colonel continued, leaning back
      in his chair, and making himself perfectly comfortable, &ldquo;all the
      girls of the Ewes connection, to the third and fourth generation, have
      olive-brown complexions, creamy and soft, but clear as crystal. Then
      again, they&rsquo;ve all got most extraordinary intuition&mdash;a
      perfectly marvellous gift of reading faces. By George, sir,&rdquo; the
      Colonel exclaimed, growing hot and red at the memory of that afternoon on
      the Holkers&rsquo; lawn, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to see those women&rsquo;s
      eyes fixed upon my cheek when there&rsquo;s anything going on I don&rsquo;t
      want them to know. A man&rsquo;s transparent like glass before them. They
      see into his very soul. They look right through him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the lady who founded the family habits was a fortune-teller,&rdquo;
      the manager interposed, with a scientific air, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not so
      remarkable; for fortune-tellers must always be quick-witted people, keen
      to perceive the changes of countenance in the dupes who employ them, and
      prompt at humouring all the fads and fancies of their customers, mustn&rsquo;t
      they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; the Colonel echoed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it on
      the nail. And this particular lady&mdash;Esmeralda they call her, so that
      Elma, which is short for Esmeralda, understand, has come to be the regular
      Christian name among all her women descendants&mdash;this particular lady
      belonged to what you might call a caste or priestly family, as it were, of
      hereditary fortune-tellers, every one of whose ancestors had been
      specially selected for generations for the work, till a kind of
      transmissible mesmeric habit got developed among them. And they do say,&rdquo;
      the Colonel went on, lowering his voice a little more to a confidential
      whisper, &ldquo;that all the girls descended from Madame Esmeralda&mdash;Lady
      Ewes of Charlwood, as she was in England&mdash;retain to this day another
      still odder and uncannier mark of their peculiar origin; but, of course,
      it&rsquo;s a story that would be hard to substantiate, though I&rsquo;ve
      heard it discussed more than once among the friends of the family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; the manager asked, in a tone of
      marked curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they do say,&rdquo; the Colonel went on, now fairly launched
      upon a piece of after-dinner gossip, &ldquo;that the eastern snake-dance
      of Madame Esmeralda&rsquo;s people is hereditary even still among the
      women of the family, and that, sooner or later, it breaks out unexpectedly
      in every one of them. When the fit comes on, they shut themselves up in
      their own rooms, I&rsquo;ve been told, and twirl round and round for hours
      like dancing dervishes, with anything they can get in their hands to
      represent a serpent, till they fall exhausted with the hysterical effort.
      Even if a woman of Esmeralda&rsquo;s blood escapes it at all other times,
      it&rsquo;s sure to break out when she first sees a real live snake, or
      falls in love for the first time. Then the dormant instincts of the race
      come over her with a rush, at the very dawn of womanhood, all quickened
      and aroused, as it were, in the general awakening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very curious!&rdquo; the manager said, leaning back in
      his chair in turn, and twirling his thumbs, &ldquo;very curious indeed;
      and yet, in its way, very probable, very probable. For habits like those
      must set themselves deep in the very core of the system, don&rsquo;t you
      think, Colonel? If this woman, now, was descended from a whole line of
      ancestresses, who had all been trained for their work into a sort of
      ecstatic fervour, the ecstasy and all that went with it must have got so
      deeply ingrained&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; the Colonel interrupted, consulting his
      watch and seizing his hat hastily&mdash;for as a Kelmscott, he refused
      point-blank to be lectured&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an appointment at my
      club at half-past three, and I must not wait any longer. Well, you&rsquo;ll
      get these young men&rsquo;s address for me, then, at the very earliest
      possible opportunity?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The manager pocketed the snub, and bowed his farewell. &ldquo;Oh,
      certainly,&rdquo; he answered, trying to look as pleased and gracious as
      his features would permit. &ldquo;Our confidential clerk will hunt them up
      immediately. We&rsquo;re delighted to be of use to you. Good morning. Good
      morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as soon as the Colonel&rsquo;s back was turned, the manager rang twice
      on his sharp little bell for the confidential clerk to receive his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montague Nevitt immediately presented himself in answer to the
      summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Nevitt,&rdquo; the manager said, with a dry, small cough,
      &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a bit of business of the most domestic kind&mdash;strict
      seal of secrecy, not a word on any account. Colonel Kelmscott of Tilgate
      wants to know where two young men, named Guy and Cyril Waring, keep their
      banking account, if any; and, as soon as he knows, he wishes to pay in a
      substantial sum, quite privately, to their credit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Montague Nevitt bowed a bow of assent; without the faintest sign of
      passing recognition. &ldquo;Guy and Cyril Waring,&rdquo; he repeated to
      himself, looking close at the scrap of paper his chief had handed him;
      &ldquo;Guy and Cyril Waring, Staple Inn, Holborn. I can find out to-day,
      sir, if you attach any special and pressing importance to promptitude in
      the matter.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; MUSIC HATH POWER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For Mr. Montague Nevitt was a cautious, cool, and calculating person. He
      knew, better than most of us that knowledge is power. So when the manager
      mentioned to him casually in the way of business the names of Guy and
      Cyril Waring, Mr. Montague Nevitt didn&rsquo;t respond at once, &ldquo;Oh,
      dear yes; one of them&rsquo;s my most intimate personal friend, and the
      other&rsquo;s his brother,&rdquo; as a man of less discretion might have
      been tempted to do. For, in the first place, by finding out, or seeming to
      find out, the facts about the Warings that very afternoon, he could
      increase his character with his employers for zeal and ability. And, in
      the second place, if he had let out too soon that he knew the Warings
      personally, he might most likely on that very account have been no further
      employed in carrying into execution this delicate little piece of family
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Nevitt held his peace discreetly, like a wise man that he was, and
      answered merely, in a most submissive voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best
      to ascertain where they bank, at once,&rdquo; as if he had never before in
      his life heard the name of Waring.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the self-same reason, Mr. Montague Nevitt didn&rsquo;t hint that
      evening to Guy that he had become possessed during the course of the day
      of a secret of the first importance to Guy&rsquo;s fortune and future. Of
      course, a man so astute as Montague Nevitt jumped at once at the correct
      conclusion, that Colonel Kelmscott must be the two Warings&rsquo; father.
      But he wasn&rsquo;t going to be fool enough to chuck his chance away by
      sharing that information with any second person. A secret is far too
      valuable a lever in life to be carelessly flung aside by a man of
      ambition. And Montague Nevitt saw this secret in particular was doubly
      valuable to him. He could use it, wedge-wise, with both the Warings in all
      his future dealings, by promising to reveal to one or other of them a
      matter of importance and probable money-value, and he could use it also as
      a perpetual threat to hold over Colonel Kelmscott, if ever it should be
      needful to extort blackmail from the possessor of Tilgate, or to thwart
      his schemes by some active interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when Nevitt strolled round about nine o&rsquo;clock that night to
      Staple Inn, violin-case in hand, and cigarette in mouth, he gave not a
      sign of the curious information he had that day acquired, to the person
      most interested in learning the truth as to the precise genealogy of the
      Waring family.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no great underlying community of interests between the clever
      young journalist and his banking companion. A common love for music was
      the main bond of union between the two men. Yet Montague Nevitt exercised
      over Guy a strange and fatal fascination which Cyril always found
      positively unaccountable. And on this particular evening, as Nevitt stood
      swaying himself to and fro upon the hearth-rug before the empty grate,
      with his eyes half closed, drawing low, weird music with his enchanted bow
      from those submissive strings, Guy leaned back on the sofa and listened,
      entranced, with a hopeless feeling of utter inability ever to approach the
      wizard-like and supreme execution of that masterly hand and those
      superhuman fingers. How he twisted and turned them as though his bones
      were india-rubber. His palms were all joints, and his eyes all ecstasy. He
      seemed able to do what he liked with his violin. He played on his
      instrument, indeed, as he played on Guy&mdash;with the consummate art of a
      skilful executant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s marvellous, Nevitt,&rdquo; Guy broke out at last;
      &ldquo;never heard even Sarasate himself do anything quite so wild and
      weird as that. What&rsquo;s the piece called? It seems to have something
      almost impish or sprite-like in its wailing music. It&rsquo;s Hungarian,
      of course, or Polish or Greek; I detect at once the Oriental tinge in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong for once, my dear boy,&rdquo; Nevitt answered, smiling,
      &ldquo;it&rsquo;s English, pure English, and by a lady what&rsquo;s more&mdash;one
      of the Eweses of Kenilworth. She&rsquo;s a distant relation of Cyril&rsquo;s
      Miss Clifford, I believe. An Elma, too; name runs in the family. But she
      composes wonderfully. Everything she writes is in that mystic key. It
      sounds like a reminiscence of some dim and lamp-lit eastern temple. The
      sort of thing a nautch-girl might be supposed to compose, to sing to the
      clash and clang of cymbals, while she was performing the snake-dance
      before some Juggernaut idol!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Guy answered, shutting his eyes dreamily. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      just the very picture it brings up before my mind&rsquo;s eye&mdash;as you
      render it, Nevitt. I seem to see vague visions of some vast and
      dimly-lighted rock-hewn cavern, with long vistas of pillars cut from the
      solid stone, while dark-limbed priestesses, clad in white muslin robes,
      swing censers in the foreground to solemn music. Upon my word, the power
      of sound is something simply wonderful. There&rsquo;s almost nothing, I
      believe, good music wouldn&rsquo;t drive me to&mdash;or rather lead me to;
      for it sways one and guides even more than it impels one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Nevitt mused, in slow tones to himself, taking up
      his violin again, and drawing his bow over the chords, with half-closed
      eyes, in a seemingly listless, aimless manner, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      believe music&rsquo;s your real first love, Guy. You took it up only to be
      different from Cyril. The artistic impulse in both of you is the same at
      bottom. If you&rsquo;d let it have it&rsquo;s own way, you&rsquo;d have
      taken, not to this, I&rsquo;m sure, but to painting. But Cyril painted,
      so, to make yourself different, you went in for music. That&rsquo;s you
      all over! You always have such a hankering after being what you are not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hang it all, a man wants to have SOME individuality,&rdquo;
      Guy answered apologetically. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like to be a mere
      copy or repetition of his brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt reflected quietly to himself that Cyril never wanted to be
      different from Guy, his was by far the stronger nature of the two: he was
      content to be himself without regard to his brother. But Nevitt didn&rsquo;t
      say so. Indeed, why should he? He merely went on playing a few
      disconnected bars of a very lively, hopeful utopian sort of a tune&mdash;a
      tune all youth and health, and go and gaiety&mdash;as he interjected from
      time to time some brief financial remarks on the numerous good strokes he&rsquo;d
      pulled off of late in his transactions in the City.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do them in my own name, you know,&rdquo; he observed
      lightly, at last laying down his bow, and replacing the dainty white rose
      in his left top buttonhole. &ldquo;Not official for a bank EMPLOYE to
      operate on the Stock Exchange. The chiefs object to it. So I do my little
      ventures in Tom&rsquo;s name instead, my brother-in-law, Tom Whitley&rsquo;s.
      Those Cedulas went up another eighth yesterday. Well hit again: I&rsquo;m
      always lucky. And that was a good thing I put you on last week, too, wasn&rsquo;t
      it? Did you sell out to-day? They&rsquo;re up at 96, and you bought in at
      80.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t sell to-day,&rdquo; Guy answered, with a yawn.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m holding on still for a further rise. I thought I&rsquo;d
      sell out when they reached the even hundred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; Nevitt put in eagerly.
      &ldquo;You ought to have sold to-day. It&rsquo;s the top of the market.
      They&rsquo;ll begin to decline soon, and when once they begin they&rsquo;ll
      come down with a crash, as P.L.&lsquo;s did on Saturday. You take my
      advice and sell out first thing to-morrow morning. You&rsquo;ll clear
      sixteen pounds on each of your shares. That&rsquo;s enough for any man.
      You bought ten shares, I think, didn&rsquo;t you? Well, there you are, you
      see; a hundred and sixty off-hand for you on your bargain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy paused and reflected a doubtful moment. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll sell
      out to-morrow, Nevitt,&rdquo; he said, after a struggle, &ldquo;or what
      comes to the same thing, you can sell out for me. But, do you know, my
      dear fellow, I sometimes fancy I&rsquo;m a fool for my pains, going in for
      all this silly speculation. Better stick to my guinea a column in the
      Morning Mail. The risks are so great, and the gains so small. I don&rsquo;t
      believe outsiders ought to back their luck at all like this on the Stock
      Exchange.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague Nevitt acquiesced with cheerful promptitude. &ldquo;I agree with
      you down to the ground,&rdquo; he said, lighting a cigarette, and puffing
      away at it vigorously. &ldquo;Outsiders ought not to back their luck on
      the Stock Exchange. That, I take it, is a self-evident proposition. But
      the point is, here, that you&rsquo;re not an outsider; and you don&rsquo;t
      back your luck, which alters the case, you&rsquo;ll admit, somewhat. You
      embark on speculations on my advice only, and I&rsquo;m in a position to
      judge, as well as any other expert in the City of London, what things are
      genuine and what things are not worth a wise man&rsquo;s attention.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stretched himself on the sofa with a lazy, luxurious air, and continued
      to puff away in silence at his cigarette for another ten minutes. Then he
      drew unostentatiously from his pocket a folded sheet of foolscap paper,
      printed after the fashion of the common company prospectus. For a second
      or two he read it over to himself in silence, till Guy&rsquo;s curiosity
      was sufficiently roused by his mute proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; the journalist asked at last,
      eyeing it inquiringly, as the fly eyes the cobweb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; Nevitt answered, folding the paper up neatly
      and returning it to his pocket. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sworn off now, so it
      does not concern you. Just the prospectus of a little fresh thing coming
      out next week&mdash;a very exceptional chance&mdash;but you don&rsquo;t
      want to go in for it. I mean to apply for three hundred shares myself, I&rsquo;m
      so certain of its success; and I had thought of advising you to take a
      hundred and fifty on your own account as well, with that hundred and fifty
      you cleared over the Cordova Cattle bonds. They&rsquo;re ten-pound shares,
      at a merely nominal price&mdash;ten bob on application and ten on
      allotment&mdash;you could take a hundred and fifty as easy as look at it.
      No further calls will ever be made. It&rsquo;s really a most remarkable
      investment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see the prospectus,&rdquo; Guy murmured, faltering, the
      fever of speculation once more getting the better of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt pretended to hang back like a man with fine scruples. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      the Rio Negro Diamond and Sapphire Mine, Limited,&rdquo; he said, with a
      deprecatory air. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;d better not go in for it. I expect
      to make a pot out of the thing myself. It&rsquo;s a unique occasion.
      Still, no doubt you&rsquo;re right, and I don&rsquo;t like the
      responsibility of advising any other fellow. Though you can see for
      yourself what the promoters say. Very first-class names. And Klink thinks
      most highly of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed Guy the paper, and took up his violin as if by pure accident,
      while Guy scanned it closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist bent over the prospectus with eager eyes, and Nevitt poured
      forth strange music as he read, music like the murmur of the stream of
      Pactolus. It was an inspiring strain; the violin seemed to possess the
      true Midas touch; gold flowed like water in liquid rills from its catgut.
      Guy finished, and rose, and dipped a pen in the ink-pot. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo;
      he said low, half hesitating still. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you an order to
      sell out at once, and I&rsquo;ll fill up this application for three
      hundred shares&mdash;why not three hundred? I may as well go as many as
      you do. If it&rsquo;s really such a good thing as you say, why shouldn&rsquo;t
      I profit by it? Send this to Klink to-morrow early; strike while the iron&rsquo;s
      hot, and get the thing finished.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt looked at the paper with an attentive eye. &ldquo;How curious it
      is,&rdquo; he said, regarding the signature narrowly, &ldquo;that you and
      Cyril, who are so much alike in everything else, should write so
      differently. I should have expected your hands to be almost identical.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you know why that is?&rdquo; Guy answered, with an
      innocent smile. &ldquo;I do it on purpose. Cyril writes sloping forward,
      the ordinary way, so I slope backward just to prevent confusion. And I
      form all my letters as unlike his as I can, though if I follow my own bent
      they turn out the same; his way is more natural to me, in fact, than the
      way I write myself. But I must do something to keep our letters apart.
      That&rsquo;s why we always bank at a different banker&rsquo;s. If I liked
      I could write exactly like Cyril. See, here&rsquo;s his own signature to
      his letter this morning, and here&rsquo;s my imitation of it, written
      off-hand, in my own natural manner. No forger on earth could ever need
      anything more absolutely identical.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague Nevitt took it up, and examined it with interest. &ldquo;Well,
      this is wonderful,&rdquo; he said, comparing the two, stroke for stroke,
      with the practised eye of an expert. &ldquo;The signatures are as if
      written by the self-same hand. Any cashier in England would accept your
      cheque at sight for Cyril&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t add aloud that such similarity was very convenient. But,
      none the less, in his own mind he thought so.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. &mdash; THE PATH OF DUTY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Down at Tilgate, meanwhile, Elma Clifford had met more than once with
      Cyril Waring at friends&rsquo; houses around, for ever since the accident,
      Society had made up its mind that Elma ought to marry her companion in the
      tunnel; and, when Society once makes up its mind on a question of this
      sort, why, it does its level best in the long run to insure the fulfilment
      of its own prediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherever Elma had met her painter, however, during those few short weeks,
      she had seen him only before the quizzing eyes of all the world; and
      though she admitted to herself that she liked him very much, she was
      nevertheless so thoroughly frightened by her own performance after the
      Holkers&rsquo; party that she almost avoided him, in spite of officious
      friends&mdash;partly, it is true, from a pure feeling of maidenly shame,
      but partly also from a deeper-seated and profoundly moral belief that with
      this fierce mad taint upon her as she naturally thought, it would be
      nothing short of wrong in her even to marry. She couldn&rsquo;t meet Cyril
      now without thinking at once of that irresistible impulse which had seized
      her by the throat, as it were, and bent her to its wild will in her own
      room after their interview at the Holkers&rsquo;; and the thought did far
      more than bring a deep blush into her rich brown cheek&mdash;it made her
      feel most acutely she must never dream of burdening him with that terrible
      uncertainty and all it might enclose in it of sinister import.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Elma felt sure she was mad that night. And, if so, oh, how could she
      poison Cyril Waring&rsquo;s life with so unspeakable an inheritance for
      himself and his children?
    </p>
    <p>
      She didn&rsquo;t know, what any psychologist might at once have told her,
      that no one with the fatal taint of madness in her blood could ever even
      have thought of that righteous self-denial. Such scruples have no place in
      the selfish insane temperament; they belong only to the highest and purest
      types of moral nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, however, a few weeks later, Elma had strolled off by herself
      into Chetwood Forest, without any intention of going anywhere in
      particular, save for a solitary walk, when suddenly, a turn round the
      corner of a devious path brought her face to face all at once with a piece
      of white canvas, stretched opposite her on an easel; at the other side of
      which, to her profound dismay, an artist in a grey tweed suit was busily
      working.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist, as it happened, didn&rsquo;t see her at once, for the canvas
      stretched between them, shutting her out from his eyes, and Elma&rsquo;s
      light footstep on the mossy ground hadn&rsquo;t aroused his attention. So
      the girl&rsquo;s first impulse was to retrace her way unobtrusively
      without exchanging a word, and retire round the corner again, before Cyril
      could recognise her. But somehow, when she came to try, she couldn&rsquo;t.
      Her feet refused point blank to obey her will. And this time, in her own
      heart, she knew very well why. For there in the background, coiled up
      against the dense wall of rock and fern, Sardanapalus lay knotted in
      sleepy folds, with his great ringed back shining blue in the sunlight that
      struggled in round patches through the shimmering foliage. More
      consciously now than even in the train, the beautiful deadly creature
      seemed to fascinate Elma and bind her to the spot. For a moment she
      hesitated, unable to resist the strange, inexplicable attraction that ran
      in her blood. That brief interval settled it. Even as she paused, Cyril
      glanced round at the snake to note the passing effect of a gleam of light
      that fell slantwise through the leaves to dapple his spotty back&mdash;and
      caught sight of Elma. The poor girl gave a start. It was too late now to
      retreat. She stood there rooted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril moved forward to meet her with a frankly outstretched hand. &ldquo;Good
      morning, Miss Clifford,&rdquo; he said, in his cheery manly voice. &ldquo;So
      you&rsquo;ve dropped down by accident upon my lair here, have you? Well, I&rsquo;m
      glad you&rsquo;ve happened to pass by to-day, for this, do you know, is my
      very last morning. I&rsquo;m putting the finishing touches upon my picture
      now before I take it back to town. I go away to-morrow, perhaps to North
      Wales, perhaps to Scotland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma trembled a little at those words, in spite of resolution; for though
      she could never, never, never marry him, it was nice, of course, to feel
      he was near at hand, and to have the chance of seeing him, and avoiding
      him as far as possible, on other people&rsquo;s lawns at garden parties.
      She trembled and turned pale. She could never MARRY him, to be sure; but
      then she could never marry any one else either; and that being so, she
      liked to SEE him now and again, on neutral ground, as it were, and to know
      he was somewhere that she could meet him occasionally. Wales and Scotland
      are so distant from Surrey. Elma showed in her face at once that she
      thought them both unpleasantly remote from Craighton, Tilgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      With timid and shrinking steps, she came in front of the picture, and
      gazed at it in detail long and attentively. Never before did she know how
      fond she was of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; she said, after a pause; &ldquo;I like
      it immensely. That moss is so soft, and the ferns are so delicate. And how
      lovely that patch of rich golden light is on Sardanapalus&rsquo;s
      shoulder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter stepped back a pace or two and examined his own handicraft,
      with his head on one side, in a very critical attitude. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know that I&rsquo;m quite satisfied after all with the colour-scheme,&rdquo;
      he said, glancing askance at Elma. &ldquo;I fancy it&rsquo;s, perhaps,
      just a trifle too green. It looks all right, of course, out here in the
      open; but the question is, when it&rsquo;s hung in the Academy, surrounded
      by warm reds, and purples, and blues, won&rsquo;t it look by comparison
      much too cabbagey and too grassy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma drew a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Waring,&rdquo; she cried, in a deprecating tone, holding
      her breath for awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It pained her that anybody&mdash;even Cyril himself&mdash;should speak so
      lightly about so beautiful a picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you like it?&rdquo; Cyril asked, turning round to her full
      face and fronting her as she stood there, all beautiful blushes through
      her creamy white skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it? I love it,&rdquo; Elma answered enthusiastically. &ldquo;Apart
      from its being yours, I think it simply beautiful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you like ME, too, then?&rdquo; the painter asked, once more,
      making a sudden dash at the question that was nearest to both their
      hearts, after all, that moment. He was going away to-morrow, and this was
      a last opportunity. Who could tell how soon somebody might come up through
      the woods and interrupt their interview? He must make the best use of his
      time. He must make haste to ask her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma let her eyes drop, and her heart beat hard. She laid her hand upon
      the easel to steady herself as she answered slowly, &ldquo;You know I like
      you, Mr. Waring; I like you very, very much indeed. You were so kind to me
      in the tunnel. And I felt your kindness. You could see that day I was&mdash;very,
      very grateful to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I asked you if you liked my picture, Elma,&rdquo; the young
      man said reproachfully, taking her other hand in his, and looking straight
      into her eyes, &ldquo;you said, &lsquo;Like it? I love it.&rsquo; But when
      I ask you if you like me&mdash;ask you if you will take me&mdash;you only
      say you&rsquo;re very, very grateful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma let him take her hand, all trembling, in his. She let him call her by
      her name. She let him lean forward and gaze at her, lover-like. Her heart
      throbbed high. She couldn&rsquo;t refuse him. She knew she loved him. But
      to marry him&mdash;oh no. That was quite another thing. There duty
      interposed. It would be cruel, unworthy, disgraceful, wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself back a little with maidenly dignity, as she answered low,
      &ldquo;Mr. Waring, we two saw into one another&rsquo;s hearts so deep in
      the tunnel that day we spent together, that it would be foolish for us now
      to make false barriers between us. I&rsquo;ll tell you the plain truth.&rdquo;
      She trembled like an aspen-leaf. &ldquo;I love you, I think; but I can
      never marry you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She said it so simply, yet with such an earnestness of despair, that Cyril
      knew with a pang she really meant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he cried eagerly, raising her hand to his lips, and
      kissing it with fervour. &ldquo;If you tell me you love me, Elma, all the
      rest must come. Say that, and you say all. So long as I&rsquo;ve gained
      your heart, I don&rsquo;t care for anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma drew her hand away with stately reserve. &ldquo;I mean it, Mr.
      Waring,&rdquo; she said slowly, sitting down on the bank, and gasping a
      little for air, just as she had done in the tunnel. &ldquo;I really mean
      it. I LIKED you in the train that day; I was GRATEFUL to you in the
      accident; I knew I LOVED you the afternoon we met at the Holkers&rsquo;.
      There, I&rsquo;ve told you that plainly&mdash;more plainly than I thought
      I ever could tell it to any man on earth&mdash;because we knew one another
      so well when we thought we were dying side by side, and because&mdash;because
      I can see you really love me.... Well, it can never be. I can never marry
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him wistfully. Cyril sat down by her side, and talked it all
      over with her from a hundred points of view. He pressed his suit hard,
      till Elma felt, if words could win, her painter would have won her. But
      she couldn&rsquo;t yield, she said for HIS sake a thousand times more than
      for her own, she must never marry. As the man grew more earnest the girl
      in turn grew more frank and confiding. She could never marry HIM, to be
      sure, she said fervently, but then she could never, never, never marry any
      one else. If she married at all she would marry Cyril. He took her hand
      again. Without one shadow of resistance she let him take it and hold it.
      Yes, yes, he might love her, if he liked, no harm at all in that; and SHE,
      she would always, always love him. All her life through, she cried,
      letting her passionate southern nature get the better of her at last, she
      would love him every hour of every day in the year, and love him only. But
      she could never marry him. Why, she must never say. It was no use his
      trying to read her secret. He must never find it out; never, never, never.
      But she, for her part, could never forget it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Cyril, eagerly pressing his suit with every art he knew, was forced in
      the end to content himself with that scanty measure. She would love him,
      she would write to him, even; but she would never marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the time came when they must really part, or she would be late for
      lunch, and mamma would know all; mamma would read everything. He looked
      her wistfully in the face. Elma held out her lips, obedient to that mute
      demand, with remorseful blush of maidenly shame on her cheek. &ldquo;Only
      once,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Just to seal our compact. For the first
      and last time. You go away to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was BEFORE you said you loved me,&rdquo; Cyril cried with
      delight, emboldened by success. &ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I stay on now, just
      one little week longer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the proposal, Elma drew back her face in haste before he had time to
      kiss it, and answered, in a very serious voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, don&rsquo;t ask me. After this, I daren&rsquo;t stand the
      strain of seeing you again&mdash;at least not just now&mdash;not so very,
      very soon. Please, please, don&rsquo;t ask me. Go to-morrow, as you said.
      If you don&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t let you,&rdquo; she blushed, and held
      out her blushing face once more. &ldquo;Only if you promise me to go
      to-morrow, mind,&rdquo; she said, with a half-coquettish, half-tearful
      smile at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril hesitated for a second. He was inclined to temporize. &ldquo;Those
      are very hard terms,&rdquo; he said. Then impulse proved too much for him.
      He bent forward, and pressed his lips just once on that olive-brown cheek.
      &ldquo;But I may come back again very soon,&rdquo; he murmured, pushing
      home his advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma seized his hand in hers, wrung it hard and tremulously, and then
      turned and ran like a frightened fawn, without pausing to look back, down
      the path homeward. Yet she whispered one broken sentence through her
      tears, for all that, before she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall love you always; but spare me, spare me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Cyril was left behind by himself in the wood, completely mystified.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. &mdash; STRUGGLE AND VICTORY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Elma hurried home full of intense misgivings. She dreaded having to meet
      her mother&rsquo;s eye. How on earth could she hide from that searching
      glance the whole truth as to what had happened in the wood that morning?
      When she reached home, however, she learned to her relief, from the maid
      who opened the door to her, that their neighbour, Mr. Gilbert
      Gildersleeve, the distinguished Q.C., had dropped in for lunch, and this
      chance diversion supplied Elma with a little fresh courage to face the
      inevitable. She went straight up to her own room the moment she entered
      the house, without seeing her mother, and there she waited, bathing her
      face copiously till some minutes after the lunch bell had rung. For she
      felt sure she would blush crimson when she met her mother; but as she
      blushed habitually when strangers came in, the cause of it might thus,
      perhaps, she vainly flattered herself, escape even those lynx-like eyes of
      Mrs. Clifford&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Q.C., a big, overbearing man, with a pair of huge burly hands
      that somehow seemed to form his chief feature, was a little bit blustering
      in his talk, as usual; the more so because he had just learned
      incidentally that something had gone wrong between his daughter Gwendoline
      and Granville Kelmscott. For though that little episode of private wooing
      had run its course nominally without the knowledge or consent of either
      family, Mr. Gilbert Gildersleeve, at least, had none the less been aware
      for many weeks past of the frequent meetings between Gwendoline and
      Granville in the dell just beyond the disputed boundary line. And as Mr.
      Gildersleeve disliked Colonel Kelmscott of Tilgate Park, for a pig-headed
      esquire, almost as cordially as Colonel Kelmscott disliked Mr.
      Gildersleeve in return for a rascally lawyer, it had given the great Q.C.
      no little secret satisfaction in his own soul to learn that his daughter
      Gwendoline was likely to marry the Colonel&rsquo;s son and heir, directly
      against the wishes and consent of his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only that very morning, however, poor Mrs. Gildersleeve, that tired,
      crushed wife, had imparted to her lord and master, in fear and trembling,
      the unpleasant intelligence that, so far as she could make out, there was
      something wrong between Granville and Gwendoline. And this something wrong
      she ventured to suggest was no mere lover&rsquo;s tiff of the ordinary
      kiss-and-make-it-up description, but a really serious difficulty in the
      way of their marriage. So Mr. Gildersleeve, thus suddenly deprived of his
      expected triumph, took it out another way by more than even his wonted
      boisterousness of manner in talking about the fortunes of the Kelmscott
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy, myself, you know, Mrs. Clifford,&rdquo; he was saying,
      very loud, as Elma entered, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a screw loose just now in
      the Kelmscott affairs&mdash;something rotten somewhere in the state of
      Denmark. That young fellow, Granville, who&rsquo;s by no means such a bad
      lot as his father all round&mdash;too good for the family, in fact; too
      good for the family&mdash;Granville&rsquo;s been accustomed of late to
      come over into my grounds, beyond the boundary wall, and being anxious
      above all things to cultivate friendly relations with all my neighbours in
      the county, I&rsquo;ve allowed him to come&mdash;I&rsquo;ve allowed him,
      and I may even say to a certain extent I&rsquo;ve encouraged him. There at
      times he&rsquo;s met by accident my daughter Gwendoline. Oh, dear no&rdquo;&mdash;with
      uplifted hand, and deprecating lips&mdash;&ldquo;I assure you, nothing of
      THAT sort, my dear Mrs. Clifford. Gwendoline&rsquo;s far too young, and I
      couldn&rsquo;t dream of allowing her to marry into Colonel Kelmscott&rsquo;s
      family. But, however, be that as it may, he&rsquo;s been in the habit of
      coming there, till very recently, when all of a sudden, only a week or ten
      days back, to my immense surprise he ceased at once, and ever since has
      dropped into the defensive, exactly as he used to do. And I interpret it
      to mean&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma heard no more of that pompous speech. Her knees shook under her. For
      she was aware only of Mrs. Clifford&rsquo;s eyes, fixed mildly and calmly
      upon her face, not in anger, as she feared, or reproach, but rather in
      infinite pity. For a second their glances met in mute intercourse of soul,
      then each dropped their eyelashes as suddenly as before. Through the rest
      of that lunch Elma sat as in a maze, hearing and seeing nothing. What she
      ate, or drank, or talked about, she knew not. Mr. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s
      pungent and embellished anecdotes of the Kelmscott family and their
      unneighbourly pride went in at one ear and out at the other. All she was
      conscious of was her mother&rsquo;s sympathetic yet unerring eye; she felt
      sure that at one glance that wonderful thought-reader had divined
      everything, and seen through and through their interview that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch, the two men strolled upon the lawn to enjoy their cigars, and
      Elma and her mother were left alone in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes neither could make up her mind to break the ice and
      speak. They sat shame-faced beside one another on the sofa, like a pair of
      shy and frightened maidens. At last Mrs. Clifford braced herself up to
      interrupt the awkward silence. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been in Chetwood
      Forest, Elma,&rdquo; she murmured low, looking down and averting her eyes
      carefully from her trembling daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; Elma answered, all aglow with conscious
      blushes. &ldquo;In Chetwood Forest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you met him, dear?&rdquo; The mother spoke tenderly and
      sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma&rsquo;s heart stood still. &ldquo;Yes, mother, I met him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he had the snake there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma started in surprise. Why dwell upon that seemingly unimportant
      detail? &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; she answered, still redder and hotter than
      ever. &ldquo;He had it there. He was painting it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clifford paused a minute. Then she went on, with pain. &ldquo;And he
      asked you, Elma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma bowed her head. &ldquo;Yes, he asked me&mdash;and I refused him,&rdquo;
      she answered, with a terrible wrench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, darling; I know it,&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford cried, seizing both
      cold hands in hers. &ldquo;And I know why, too. But, Elma, believe me, you
      needn&rsquo;t have done it. My daughter, my daughter, you might just as
      well have taken him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; Elma cried, rising from her seat and moving
      towards the door in an agony of shame. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t. I daren&rsquo;t.
      It would be wrong. It would be cruel. But, mother, don&rsquo;t speak to me
      of it. Don&rsquo;t mention it again. Even before you it makes me more
      wretched and ashamed than I can say to allude to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She rushed from the room, with cheeks burning like fire. Come what might,
      she never could talk to any living soul again about that awful episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Clifford sat on, on the sofa where Elma left her, and cried to
      herself silently, silently, silently. What a mother should do in these
      hateful circumstances she could hardly even guess. She only knew she could
      never speak it out, and even if she did, Elma would never have the courage
      or the heart to listen to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening, when Elma went up to bed, a strange longing came across
      her to sit up late, and think over to herself again all the painful
      details of the morning&rsquo;s interview. She seated herself by her
      bedside in her evening dress, and began to think it all out again, exactly
      as it happened. As she did so, the picture of Sardanapalus, on his bed of
      fern, came up clear in her mind, just as he lay coiled round in Cyril
      Waring&rsquo;s landscape. Beautiful Sardanapalus, so sleek and smooth and
      glossy, if only she had him here now&mdash;she paused and hesitated. In a
      moment, the wild impulse rushed upon her once more. It clutched her by the
      throat; it held her fast as in a vice. She must get up and dance; she must
      obey the mandate; she must whirl till she fell in that mystical ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and seemed for a moment as though she must yield to the
      temptation. The boa&mdash;the boa was in the lower drawer. Reluctantly,
      remorsefully, she opened the drawer and took it out in her hands. Fluff
      and feathers, fluff and feathers&mdash;nothing more than that! But oh, how
      soft, how smooth, how yielding, how serpentine! With a violent effort she
      steadied herself, and looked round for her scissors. They lay on the
      dressing-table. She took them up with a fixed and determined air. &ldquo;If
      thy right hand offend thee, cut it off,&rdquo; she thought to herself.
      Then she began ruthlessly hacking the boa into short little lengths of a
      few inches each, which she gathered up in her hands as soon as she had
      finished, and replaced with care in the drawer where she had originally
      found them.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that her mind felt somewhat more at ease and a trifle less
      turbulent. She loved Cyril Waring&mdash;oh yes, she loved him with all her
      heart; it was hard to give him up; hard not to yield to that pressing
      impulse in such a moment of doubt and despondency. The boa had said to
      her, as it were, &ldquo;Come, dance, go mad, and forget your trouble!&rdquo;
      But she had resisted the temptation. And now&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, now, she would undress, and creep into bed, like any other good
      English girl under similar circumstances, and cry herself asleep with
      thoughts of Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she did in truth. She let her emotion take its natural outlet. She
      lay awake for an hour or two, till her eyes were red and sore and swollen.
      Then at last she dropped off, for very weariness, and slept soundly an
      unbroken sleep till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o&rsquo;clock, Mrs. Clifford knocked her tentative little knock
      at the door. &ldquo;Come in, mother,&rdquo; Elma cried, starting up in her
      surprise; and her mother, much wondering, turned the handle and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached the bed, she gave a little cry of amazement. &ldquo;Why,
      Elma,&rdquo; she exclaimed, staring her hard and long in the face; &ldquo;my
      darling, what&rsquo;s this? Your eyes are red! How strange! You&rsquo;ve
      been crying!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; Elma answered, turning her face to the wall,
      but a thousand times less ashamed than she had been the day before when
      her mother spoke to her. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, dearest.&rdquo;
      She took that soft white hand in hers and pressed it hard in silence.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder, you know,&rdquo; she said at last, after a
      long deep pause. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going away from Chetwood to-day&mdash;and
      it was so very, very hard to say good-bye to him for ever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I know, darling,&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford answered, eyeing her
      harder than ever now with a half-incredulous look. &ldquo;I know all that.
      But&mdash;you&rsquo;ve had a good night in spite of everything, Elma.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma guessed what she meant. They two could converse together quite
      plainly without words. &ldquo;Well, yes, a better night,&rdquo; she
      answered, hesitating, and shutting her eyes under the bed-clothes for very
      shame. &ldquo;A little disturbed&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;just at
      first; but I had a good cry very soon, and then that mended everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother still looked at her, half doubting and half delighted. &ldquo;A
      good cry&rsquo;s the right thing,&rdquo; she said slowly, in a very low
      voice. &ldquo;The exact right thing, perfectly proper and normal. A good
      cry never did any girl on this earth one atom of harm. It&rsquo;s the best
      safety-valve. You&rsquo;re lucky, Elma, my child, in being able to get
      one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; Elma answered, with her head still buried.
      &ldquo;Very lucky indeed. So I think, too, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clifford&rsquo;s eye fell aimlessly upon certain tiny bits of
      feathery fluff that flecked the floor here and there like floating
      fragments of thistledown. In a second, her keen instinct divined what they
      meant. Without one word she rose silently and noiselessly, and opened the
      lower drawer, where the boa usually reposed among the furs and feathers.
      One glimpse of those mangled morsels showed her the truth at a glance. She
      shut the drawer again noiselessly and silently as she had opened it. But
      Elma, lying still with her eyes closed tight, yet knew perfectly well how
      her mother had been occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clifford came back, and, stooping over her daughter&rsquo;s bed,
      kissed her forehead tenderly. &ldquo;Elma, darling,&rdquo; she said, while
      a hot tear or two fell silently upon the girl&rsquo;s burning cheek,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;re very, very brave. I&rsquo;m so pleased with you, so
      proud of you! I couldn&rsquo;t have done it myself. You&rsquo;re
      stronger-minded than I am. My child, he kissed you for good-bye yesterday.
      You needn&rsquo;t say yes, you needn&rsquo;t say no. I read it in your
      face. No need for you to tell me of it. Well, darling, it wasn&rsquo;t
      good-bye after all, I&rsquo;m certain of that. Believe me, my child, he&rsquo;ll
      come back some day, and you&rsquo;ll know you can marry him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; Elma cried, hiding her face still more passionately
      and wildly than before beneath great folds of the bed-clothes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      speak to me of him any more, mother! Never! Never! Never!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVII. &mdash; VISIONS OF WEALTH.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cyril Waring, thus dismissed, and as in honour bound, hurried up to London
      with a mind preoccupied by many pressing doubts and misgivings. He thought
      much of Elma, but he thought much, too, of sundry strange events that had
      happened of late to his own private fortunes. For one thing he had sold,
      and sold mysteriously, at a very good price, the picture of Sardanapalus
      in the glade at Chetwood. A well-known London dealer had written down to
      him at Tilgate making an excellent offer for the unfinished work, as soon
      as it should be ready, on behalf of a customer whose name he didn&rsquo;t
      happen to mention. And who could that customer be, Cyril thought to
      himself, but Colonel Kelmscott? But that wasn&rsquo;t all. The dealer who
      had offered him a round sum down for &ldquo;The Rajah&rsquo;s Rest&rdquo;
      had also at the same time commissioned him to go over to the Belgian
      Ardennes to paint a picture or two, at a specified price, of certain
      selected scenes upon the Meuse and its tributaries. The price offered for
      the work was a very respectable one, and yet&mdash;he had some internal
      misgivings, somehow, about this mysterious commission. Could it be to get
      rid of him? He had an uncomfortable suspicion in the back chambers of his
      mind, that whoever had commissioned the pictures might be more anxious to
      send him well away from Tilgate than to possess a series of picturesque
      sketches on the Meuse and its tributaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      And who could have an interest in keeping him far from Tilgate? That was
      the question. Was there anybody whom his presence there could in any way
      incommode? Could it be Elma&rsquo;s father who wanted to send him so
      quickly away from England?
    </p>
    <p>
      And what was the meaning of Elma&rsquo;s profound resolution, so strangely
      and strongly expressed, never, never to marry him?
    </p>
    <p>
      A painful idea flitted across the young man&rsquo;s puzzled brain. Had the
      Cliffords alone discovered the secret of his birth? and was that secret of
      such a disgraceful sort that Elma&rsquo;s father shrank from owning him as
      a prospective son-in-law, while even Elma herself could not bring herself
      to accept him as her future husband? If so, what could that ghastly secret
      be? Were he and Guy the inheritors of some deadly crime? Had their origin
      been concealed from them, more in mercy than in cruelty, only lest some
      hideous taint of murder or of madness might mar their future and make
      their whole lives miserable?
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached Staple Inn, he found Guy and Montague Nevitt already in
      their joint rooms, and arrears of three days&rsquo; correspondence
      awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A close observer&mdash;like Elma Clifford&mdash;might perhaps have noted
      in Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s eye certain well-restrained symptoms of
      suppressed curiosity. But Cyril Waring, in his straightforward, simple
      English manliness, was not sharp enough to perceive that Nevitt watched
      him close while he broke the envelopes and glanced over his letters; or
      that Nevitt&rsquo;s keen anxiety grew at once far deeper and more
      carefully concealed as Cyril turned to one big missive with an
      official-looking seal and a distinctly important legal aspect. On the
      contrary, to the outer eye or ear all that could be observed in Montague
      Nevitt&rsquo;s manner was the nervous way he went on tightening his violin
      strings with a tremulous hand and whistling low to himself a few soft and
      tender bars of some melancholy scrap from Miss Ewes&rsquo;s refectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Cyril read through that letter, however, his breath came and went in
      short little gasps, and his cheek flushed hotly with a sudden and
      overpowering flood of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Guy asked, looking over his
      shoulder curiously. And Cyril, almost faint with the innumerable ideas and
      suspicions that the tidings conjured up in his brain at once, said with an
      evident effort, &ldquo;Read it, Guy; read it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy took the letter and read, Montague Nevitt gazing at it by his side
      meanwhile with profound interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they had glanced through its carefully-worded sentences, each
      drew a long breath and stared hard at the other. Then Cyril added in a
      whirl, &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s a letter from my own bankers saying they&rsquo;ve
      duly received the six thousand pounds and put it to my credit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy&rsquo;s face was pale, but he faltered out none the less with ashy
      lips, staring hard at the words all the time, &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t only
      the money, of course, one thinks about, Cyril; but the clue it seems to
      promise us to our father and mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; Cyril answered, with a responsive nod. &ldquo;The
      money I won&rsquo;t take. I don&rsquo;t know what it means. But the clue I&rsquo;ll
      follow up till I&rsquo;ve run to earth the whole truth about who we are
      and where we come from.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague Nevitt glanced quickly from one to the other with an incredulous
      air. &ldquo;Not take the money,&rdquo; he exclaimed, in cynical surprise.
      &ldquo;Why, of course you&rsquo;ll take it. Twelve thousand pounds isn&rsquo;t
      to be sneezed at in these days, I can tell you. And as for the clue, why,
      there isn&rsquo;t any clue. Not a jot or a tittle, a ghost or a shadow of
      it. The unnatural parent, whoever he may be&mdash;for I take it for
      granted the unnatural parent&rsquo;s the person at the bottom of the offer&mdash;takes
      jolly good care not to let you know who on earth he is. He wraps himself
      up in a double cloak of mystery. Drummonds pay in the money to your
      account at your own bank, you see, and while they&rsquo;re authorized to
      receive your acknowledgment of the sum remitted, they are clearly NOT
      authorized to receive to the sender&rsquo;s credit any return cheque for
      the amount or cash in repayment. The unnatural parent evidently intends to
      remain, for the present at least, strictly anonymous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you find out for us at Drummond, Coutts and Barclay&rsquo;s
      who the sender is?&rdquo; Guy asked, with some hesitation, still turning
      over in his hand the mysterious letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt shook his head with prompt decision. &ldquo;No, certainly not,&rdquo;
      he answered, assuming an air of the severest probity. &ldquo;It would be
      absolutely impossible. The secrets in a bank are secrets of honour. We are
      the depositaries of tales that might ruin thousands, and we never say a
      word about one of them to anybody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Cyril, he felt himself almost too astonished for words. It was long
      before he could even discuss the matter quietly. The whole episode seemed
      so strange, so mysterious, so uncanny. And no wonder he hesitated. For the
      unknown writer of the letter with the legal seal had proposed a most
      curious and unsatisfactory arrangement. Six thousand pounds down on the
      nail to Cyril, six thousand more in a few weeks to Guy. But not for
      nothing. As in all law business, &ldquo;valuable consideration&rdquo;
      loomed large in the background. They were both to repair, on a given day,
      at a given hour, to a given office, in a given street, where they were to
      sign without inquiry, and even without perusal, whatever documents might
      then and there be presented to them. This course, the writer pointed out,
      with perspicuous plainness, was all in the end to their own greater
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      For unless they signed, they would get nothing more, and it would be
      useless for them at attempt the unravelling of the mystery. But if they
      consented to sign, then, the writer declared, the anonymous benefactor at
      whose instigation he wrote would leave them by his will a further
      substantial sum, not one penny of which would ever otherwise come to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Montague Nevitt, as a man of business, looking the facts in the face,
      without sentiment or nonsense, advised them to sign, and make the best of
      a good bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Montague Nevitt saw at once in his own mind that this course would
      prove the most useful in the end for his own interests, both as regards
      the Warings and Colonel Kelmscott.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two persons most concerned, however, viewed the matter in a very
      different light. To them, this letter, with its obscure half-hints, opened
      up a chance of solving at last the mystery of their position which had so
      long oppressed them. They might now perhaps find out who they really were,
      if only they could follow up this pregnant clue; and the clue itself
      suggested so many things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever else it shows,&rdquo; Guy said emphatically, &ldquo;it
      shows we must be the lawful sons of some person of property, or else why
      should he want us to sign away our rights like this, all blindfold? And
      whatever the rights themselves may be, they must be very considerable, or
      else why should he bribe us so heavily to sign ourselves out of them?
      Depend upon it, Nevitt, it&rsquo;s an entailed estate, and the man who
      dictated that letter is in possession of the property, which ought to
      belong to Cyril and me. For my part, I&rsquo;m opposed to all bargaining
      in the dark. I&rsquo;ll sign nothing, and I&rsquo;ll give away nothing,
      without knowing what it is. And that&rsquo;s what I advise Cyril to write
      back and tell him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril, however, was revolving in his own mind meanwhile a still more
      painful question. Could it be any blood-relationship between himself and
      Elma, unknown to him, but just made known to her, that gave rise to her
      firm and obviously recent determination never to marry him? A week or two
      since, he was sure, Elma knew of no cause or just impediment why they
      should not be joined together in holy matrimony. Could she have learned it
      meanwhile, before she met him in the wood? and could the fact of her so
      learning it have thus pricked the slumbering conscience of their unknown
      kinsman or their supposed supplanter?
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat there long and late, discussing the question from all possible
      standpoints&mdash;save the one thus silently started in his own mind by
      Cyril. But, in the end, Cyril&rsquo;s resolution remained unshaken. He
      would leave the six thousand pounds in the bank, untouched; but he would
      write back at once to the unknown sender, declining plainly, once for all,
      to have anything to do with it or with the proposed transactions. If
      anything was his by right, he would take it as of right, but he would be
      no party to such hole-and-corner renunciations of unknown contingencies as
      the writer suggested. If the writer was willing to state at once all the
      facts of the case, in clear and succinct language, and to come to terms
      thus openly with himself and his brother, why then, Cyril averred, he was
      ready to promise they would deal with his claims in a spirit of the utmost
      generosity and consideration. But if this was an attempt to do them out of
      their rights by a fraudulent bribe, he for one would have nothing to say
      to it. He would therefore hold the six thousand pounds paid in to his
      account entirely at his anonymous correspondent&rsquo;s disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as there isn&rsquo;t any use in my wasting the summer, Guy,&rdquo;
      he said, in conclusion, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let this red-herring, trailed
      across my path, prevent me from going over at once, as I originally
      intended, to Dinant and Spa, and fulfilling the commission for those
      pictures of Dale and Norton&rsquo;s; You and Nevitt can see meanwhile what
      it&rsquo;s possible for us to do in the matter of hunting up this family
      mystery. You can telegraph if you want me, and I&rsquo;ll come back at
      once. But more than ever now I feel the need of redeeming the time and
      working as hard as I can go at my profession.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; Guy answered, as if both their thoughts ran
      naturally in the self-same channel. &ldquo;I agree with you there. She&rsquo;s
      been accustomed to luxury. No man has a right to marry any girl if he can&rsquo;t
      provide for her in the comfort and style she&rsquo;s always been used to.
      And from that point of view, when one looks it in the face, Cyril, six
      thousand pounds would come in handy.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. &mdash; GENTLE WOOER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Montague Nevitt rubbed his hands with delight in the sacred privacy of
      his own apartment. Mr. Nevitt, indeed, had laid his plans deep. He had
      everybody&rsquo;s secrets all round in his hands, and he meant to make
      everybody pay dear in the end for his information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nevitt was free. His holidays were on at Drummond, Coutts and Barclay&rsquo;s,
      Limited. He loved the sea, the sun, and the summer. He was off that day on
      a projected series of short country runs, in which it was his intention
      strictly to combine business and pleasure. Dartmoor, for example, as
      everybody knows, is a most delightful and bracing tourist district; but
      what more amusing to a man of taste than to go a round of the Moor with
      its heather-clad tors, and at the same time hunt up the parish registers
      of the neighbourhood for the purpose of discovering, if possible, the
      supposed marriage record of Colonel Kelmscott of Tilgate with the Warings&rsquo;
      mother? For that there WAS a marriage Montague Nevitt felt certain in his
      own wise mind, and having early arrived at that correct conclusion, why,
      he had quietly offered forthwith, in Plymouth papers, a considerable
      reward to parish clerks and others who would supply him with any
      information as to the births, marriages, or deaths of any person or
      persons of the name of Waring for some eighteen months or so before or
      after the reputed date when Guy and Cyril began their earthly pilgrimage.
    </p>
    <p>
      For deaths, Nevitt said to himself, with a sinister smile, were every bit
      as important to him as births or marriages. He knew the date of Colonel
      Kelmscott&rsquo;s wedding with Lady Emily Croke, and if at that date wife
      number one was not yet dead, when the Colonel took to himself wife number
      two, who now did the honours of Tilgate Park for him, why, there you had
      as clear and convincing a case of bigamy as any man could wish to find out
      against another, and to utilize some day for his own good purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he thought these thoughts, Montague Nevitt gave the last delicate
      twirl, the final touch of art, to the wire-like ends of his waxed
      moustache, in front of his mirror, and, after surveying the result in the
      glass with considerable satisfaction, proceeded to set out, on very good
      terms with himself, for his summer holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devonshire, however, wasn&rsquo;t his first destination. Montague Nevitt,
      besides being a man of business and a man of taste, was also in due season
      a man of feeling. A heart beat beneath that white rosebud in his left top
      button-hole. All his thoughts were not thoughts of greed and of gain. He
      was bound to Tilgate to-day, and to see a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      It isn&rsquo;t so easy in England to see a lady alone. But fortune favours
      the brave. Luck always attended Mr. Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s most
      unimportant schemes. Hardly had he got into the field path across the
      meadows between Tilgate station and the grounds of Woodlands than, at the
      seat by the bend, what should he see but a lady sitting down in an airy
      white summer dress, her head leaning on her hand, most pensive and
      melancholy. Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s heart gave a sudden bound. In luck
      once more. It was Gwendoline Gildersleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; he said briskly, coming up before Gwendoline
      had time to perceive him&mdash;and fly. &ldquo;This is really most
      fortunate. I&rsquo;ve run down from town today on purpose to see you, but
      hardly hoped I should have the good fortune to get a tete-a-tete with you&mdash;at
      least so easily. I&rsquo;m so glad I&rsquo;m in time. Now, don&rsquo;t
      look so cross. You must at any rate admit, you know, my persistence is
      flattering.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel flattered by it, Mr. Nevitt,&rdquo; Gwendoline
      answered coldly, holding out her gloved hand to him with marked
      disinclination. &ldquo;I thought last time I had said good-bye to you for
      good and for ever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt took her hand, and held it in his own a trifle longer than was
      strictly necessary. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t talk like that, Gwendoline,&rdquo;
      he said coaxingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crush me quite flat. Remember at
      least that you ONCE were kind to me. It isn&rsquo;t my fault, surely, if
      <i>I</i> still recollect it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendoline withdrew her hand from his with yet more evident coolness.
      &ldquo;Circumstances alter cases,&rdquo; she said severely. &ldquo;That
      was before I really knew you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was before you knew Granville Kelmscott, you mean,&rdquo;
      Nevitt responded with an unpleasantly knowing air. &ldquo;Oh yes, you
      needn&rsquo;t wince; I&rsquo;ve heard all about that. It&rsquo;s my
      business to hear and find out everything. But circumstances alter cases,
      as you justly say, Gwendoline. And I&rsquo;ve discovered some
      circumstances about Granville Kelmscott that may alter the case as regards
      your opinion of that rich young man, whose estate weighed down a poor
      fellow like me in what you&rsquo;ve graciously pleased to call your
      affections.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendoline rose, and looked down at the man contemptuously. &ldquo;Mr.
      Nevitt,&rdquo; she said, in a chilling voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve no right
      to call me Gwendoline any longer now. You&rsquo;ve no right to speak to me
      of Mr. Granville Kelmscott. I refused your advances, not for any one else&rsquo;s
      sake, or any one else&rsquo;s estate, but simply and solely because I came
      to know you better than I knew you at first; and the more I knew of you
      the less I liked you. I am NOT engaged to Mr. Granville Kelmscott. I don&rsquo;t
      mean to see him again. I don&rsquo;t mean to marry him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt took his cue at once, like a clever hand that he was, and followed
      it up remorselessly. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear that anyhow,&rdquo;
      he answered, assuming a careless air of utter unconcern, &ldquo;for your
      sake as well as for his, Miss Gildersleeve; for Granville Kelmscott, as I
      happen to know in the course of business, is a ruined man&mdash;a ruined
      man this moment. He isn&rsquo;t, and never was, the heir of Tilgate. And I&rsquo;m
      sure it was very honourable of him, the minute he found he was a penniless
      beggar, to release you from such an unequal engagement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had played his card well. He had delivered his shot neatly. Gwendoline,
      though anxious to withdraw from his hateful presence, couldn&rsquo;t help
      but stay and learn more about this terrible hint of his. A light broke in
      upon her even as the fellow spoke. Was it this, then, that had made
      Granville talk so strangely to her that morning by the dell in the
      Woodlands? Was it this which, as he told her, rendered their marriage
      impossible? Why, if THAT were all&mdash;Gwendoline drew a deep breath and
      clasped her hands together in a sudden access of mingled hope and despair.
      &ldquo;Oh, what do you mean, Mr. Nevitt,&rdquo; she cried eagerly. &ldquo;What
      can Granville have done? Don&rsquo;t keep me in suspense! Do tell me what
      you mean by it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague Nevitt, still seated, looked up at her with a smile of quiet
      satisfaction. He played with her for a moment as a cat plays with a mouse.
      She was such a beautiful creature, so tall and fair and graceful, and she
      was so awfully afraid, and he was so awfully fond of her, that he loved to
      torture her thus and hold her dangling in his power. &ldquo;No,
      Gwendoline,&rdquo; he said slowly, drawing his words out by driblets, so
      as to prolong her suspense, &ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to have mentioned it
      at all. It&rsquo;s a professional secret. I retract what I said. Forget
      that I said it. Excuse me on the ground of my natural reluctance to see a
      woman I still love so deeply and so purely&mdash;whatever she may happen
      to think of ME&mdash;throw herself away on a man without a name or a
      penny. However, as Kelmscott seems to have done the honourable thing of
      his own accord, and given you up the minute he knew he couldn&rsquo;t keep
      you in the way you&rsquo;ve been accustomed to&mdash;why, there&rsquo;s no
      need, of course, of any warning from me. I&rsquo;ll say no more on the
      subject.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His studied air of mystery piqued and drew on his victim. Gwendoline knew
      in her own heart she ought to go at once; her own dignity demanded it, and
      she should consult her dignity. But still, she couldn&rsquo;t help longing
      to know what Nevitt&rsquo;s half-hints and innuendoes might mean. After
      all, she was a woman! &ldquo;Oh, do tell me,&rdquo; she cried, clasping
      her hands in suspense once more; &ldquo;what have you heard about Mr.
      Kelmscott? I&rsquo;m not engaged to him; I don&rsquo;t want to know for
      that, but&mdash;&rdquo; she broke down, blushing crimson, and Montague
      Nevitt, gazing fixedly at her delicate peach-like cheek, remarked to
      himself how extremely well that blush became her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but remember,&rdquo; he said in a very grave voice, in his
      favourite impersonation of the man of honour, &ldquo;whatever I tell you&mdash;if
      I give way at all and tell you anything&mdash;you must hear in confidence,
      and must repeat to nobody. If you do repeat it, you&rsquo;ll get me into
      very serious trouble. And not only so, but as nobody knows it except
      myself, you&rsquo;ll as good as proclaim to all the world that you heard
      it from ME. If I tell you what I know, will you promise me this&mdash;not
      to breathe a syllable of what I say to anybody?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendoline, glancing down, and thoroughly ashamed of herself, yet answered
      in a very low and trembling voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise, Mr. Nevitt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the facts are these,&rdquo; the man of feeling went on, with
      an undercurrent of malicious triumph in his musical voice. &ldquo;Kelmscott
      is NOT his father&rsquo;s eldest son; he&rsquo;s NOT, and never was, the
      heir of Tilgate. More than that, nobody knows these facts but myself. And
      I know the true heirs, and I can prove their title. Well, now, Miss
      Gildersleeve&mdash;if it&rsquo;s to be Miss Gildersleeve still&mdash;this
      is the circumstance that alters the case as regards Granville Kelmscott. I
      have it in my hands to ruin Kelmscott. And what I&rsquo;ve taken the
      trouble to come down and say to you to-day is simply this for your own
      advantage; beware, at least, how you throw yourself away upon a penniless
      man, with neither name nor fortune! When you&rsquo;ve quite got over that
      dream, you&rsquo;ll be glad to return to the man you threw overboard for
      the rich squire&rsquo;s son. No circumstances have ever altered him. He
      loved you from the first, and he will always love you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendoline looked him back in the face again, as pale as death. &ldquo;Mr.
      Nevitt,&rdquo; she said scornfully, unmoved by his tale, &ldquo;I do not
      love you, and I will never love you. You have no right to say such things
      to me as this. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve told me, for I now know what
      Mr. Kelmscott meant. And if he was as poor as a church mouse, I&rsquo;d
      marry him to-morrow&mdash;I said just now I didn&rsquo;t mean to marry
      him. I retract that word. Circumstances alter cases, and what you&rsquo;ve
      just told me alters this one. I withdraw what I said. I&rsquo;ll marry
      Granville Kelmscott to-morrow if he asks me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked down at him so proudly, so defiantly, so haughtily, that
      Montague Nevitt, sitting there with his cynical smile on his thin red
      lips, flinched and wavered before her. He saw in a moment the game was up.
      He had played the wrong card; he had mistaken his woman and tried false
      tactics. It was too late now to retreat. An empty revenge was all that
      remained to him. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said sullenly, looking her
      back in the face with a nasty scowl&mdash;for indeed he loved that girl
      and was loath to lose her&mdash;&ldquo;remember your promise, and say
      nothing to anybody. You&rsquo;ll find it best so for your own reputation
      in the end. But mark my words; be sure I won&rsquo;t spare Granville
      Kelmscott now. I&rsquo;ll play my own game. I&rsquo;ll ruin him
      ruthlessly. He&rsquo;s in my power, I tell you, and I&rsquo;ll crush him
      under my heel. Well, that&rsquo;s settled at last. I&rsquo;m off to
      Devonshire to-morrow&mdash;on the hunt of the records&mdash;to the skirts
      of Dartmoor, to a place in the wilds by the name of Mambury.&rdquo; He
      raised his hat, and, curling his lip maliciously, walked away, without
      even so much as shaking hands with her. He knew it was all up. That game
      was lost. And, being a man of feeling, he regretted it bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendoline, for her part, hurried home, all aglow with remorse and
      excitement. When she reached the house, she went straight up in haste to
      her own bedroom. In spite of her promise, all woman that she was, she
      couldn&rsquo;t resist sitting down at once and inditing a hurried note to
      Granville Kelmscott.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Granville,&rdquo; it said, in a very shaky hand, not
      unblurred by tears, &ldquo;I know all now, and I wonder you thought it
      could ever matter. I know you&rsquo;re not the eldest son, and that
      somebody else is the heir of Tilgate. And I care for all that a great deal
      less than nothing. I love you ten thousand times too dearly to mind one
      pin whether you&rsquo;re rich or poor. And, rich or poor, whenever you
      like, I&rsquo;ll marry you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours ever devotedly and unalterably,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;GWENDOLINE.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      She sealed it up in haste and ran out with it, all tremors, to the post by
      herself. Her hands were hot. She was in a high fever. But Mr. Montague
      Nevitt, that man of feeling, thus balked of his game, walked off his
      disappointment as well as he could by a long smart tramp across the
      springy downs, lunching at a wayside inn on bread and cheese and beer, and
      descending as the evening shades drew in on the Guildford station. Thence
      he ran up to town by the first fast train, and sauntered sulkily across
      Waterloo Bridge to his rooms on the Embankment. As he went a poster caught
      his eye on the bridge. It riveted his attention by one fatal phrase.
      &ldquo;Financial News. Collapse of the Rio Negro Diamond and Sapphire
      Mines!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at the placard with a dim sense of disaster. What on earth could
      this mean? It fairly took his breath away. The mines were the best things
      out this season. He held three hundred shares on his own account. If this
      rumour were true, he had let himself in for a loss of a clear three
      thousand!
    </p>
    <p>
      But being a person of restricted sympathies, he didn&rsquo;t reflect till
      several minutes had passed that he must at the same time have let Guy
      Waring in for three thousand also.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. &mdash; SELF OR BEARER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At Charing Cross Station Montague Nevitt bought a Financial News and
      proceeded forthwith to his own rooms to read of the sudden collapse of his
      pet speculation. It was only too true. The Rio Negro Diamond and Sapphire
      Mines had gone entirely in one of the periodical South American crashes
      which involved them in the liabilities of several other companies. A call
      would be made at once to the full extent of the nominal capital. And he
      would have to find three thousand pounds down to meet the demand on his
      credit immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt hadn&rsquo;t three thousand pounds in the world to pay. The little
      he possessed beyond his salary was locked up, here and there, in
      speculative undertakings, where he couldn&rsquo;t touch it except at long
      notice. It was a crushing blow. He had need of steadying. Some men would
      have flown in such a plight to brandy. Montague Nevitt flew, instead, to
      the consolations of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes, indeed, he paced his room up and down in solemn silence.
      Then his eye fell by accident on the violin case in the corner. Ah, that
      would do! That beloved violin would inspire him with ideas; was it suicide
      or fraud? or some honest way out: be it this plan or that the violin would
      help him. Screwing up the strings for a minute with those deft, long,
      double-jointed fingers of his, he took the bow in his right hand, and,
      still pacing the room with great strides, like a wild beast in its cage,
      began to discourse low passionate music to himself from one of those
      serpentine pieces of Miss Ewes&rsquo;s of Leamington.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he played and played, his whole soul in his fingers, a plan began to
      frame itself, vaguely, dimly at first, then more and more definitely by
      slow degrees&mdash;shape, form, and features&mdash;as it grew and
      developed. A beautiful chord, that last! Oh, how subtle, how beautiful! It
      seemed to curl and glide on like a serpent through the grass, leaving
      strange trails behind as of a flowing signature; a flowing signature with
      bold twirls and flourishes&mdash;twirls and flourishes&mdash;twirls and
      flourishes&mdash;twirls, twirls, twirls and flourishes; the signature to a
      cheque; to a cheque for money; three thousand pounds at Drummond, Coutts
      and Barclay&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      It ran through his head, keeping time with the bars. Four thousand pounds;
      five thousand; six thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The longer he played the clearer and sharper the plan stood out. He saw
      his way now as clear as daylight. And his way too, to make a deal more in
      the end by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pay self or bearer six thousand pounds! Six thousand pounds;
      signed, Cyril Waring!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For hours he paced up and down there, playing long and low. Oh, music, how
      he loved it; it seemed to set everything straight all at once in his head.
      With bow in hand and violin at rest, he surpassed himself that evening in
      ingenuity of fingering. He trembled to think of his own cleverness and
      skill. What a miracle of device! What a triumph of cunning! Not an element
      was overlooked. It was safe as houses. He could go to bed now, and drop
      off like a child; having arranged before he went to make Guy Waring his
      cat&rsquo;s paw, and turn this sad stroke of ill-luck in the end to his
      own ultimate greater and wider advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was quite right too. He did sleep as he expected. Next morning he
      woke in a very good humour, and proceeded at once to Guy Waring&rsquo;s
      rooms the moment after breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Guy, as he expected, in a tumult of excitement, having only just
      that moment received by post the final call for the Rio Negro capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      When other men are excited the wise man takes care to be perfectly calm.
      Montague Nevitt was calm under this crushing blow. He pointed out blandly
      that everything would yet go well. All was not lost. They had other irons
      in the fire. And even the Rio Negros themselves were not an absolute
      failure. The diamonds, the diamonds themselves, he insisted, were still
      there, and the sapphires also. They studded the soil, they were to be had
      for the picking. Every bit of their money would come back to them in the
      end. It was a question of meeting an immediate emergency only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t three thousand pounds in the world to meet it
      with,&rdquo; Guy exclaimed in despair. &ldquo;I shall be ruined, of
      course. I don&rsquo;t mind about that; but I never shall be able to make
      good my liabilities!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt lighted a cigarette with a philosophical smile. The hotter Guy
      waxed, the faster did he cool down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither have I, my dear boy,&rdquo; he said, in his most careless
      voice, puffing out rings of smoke in the interval between his clauses;
      &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t, therefore, go mad. I don&rsquo;t tear my hair
      over it; though, to be sure, I&rsquo;m a deal worse off than you. My
      position&rsquo;s at stake. If Drummonds were to hear of it&mdash;sack&mdash;sack
      instanter. As to making yourself responsible for what you don&rsquo;t
      possess, that&rsquo;s simply speculation. Everybody on the Stock Exchange
      always does it. If they didn&rsquo;t there&rsquo;d be no such thing as
      enterprise at all. You can&rsquo;t make a fortune by risking a ha&rsquo;penny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what am I to do?&rdquo; Guy cried wildly. &ldquo;However am I
      to raise three thousand pounds? I should be ashamed to let Cyril know I&rsquo;d
      defaulted like this. If I can&rsquo;t find the money I shall go mad or
      kill myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague Nevitt played him gently, as an experienced angler plays a
      plunging trout, before proceeding to land him. At last, after offering Guy
      much sympathetic advice, and suggesting several intentionally feeble
      schemes, only to quash them instantly, he observed with a certain
      apologetic air of unobtrusive friendliness, &ldquo;Well, if the worst
      comes to the worst, you&rsquo;ve one thing to fall back upon: There&rsquo;s
      that six-thousand, of course, coming in by-and-by from the unknown
      benefactor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy flung himself down in his easy-chair, with a look of utter despondency
      upon his handsome face. &ldquo;But I promised Cyril,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      with a groan, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never touch that. If I were to spend it I
      don&rsquo;t know how I could ever face Cyril.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told yesterday,&rdquo; Nevitt answered, with a bitter little
      smile, &ldquo;and by a lady, too, many times over, that circumstances
      alter cases, till I began to believe it. When you promised Cyril you weren&rsquo;t
      face to face with a financial crisis. If you were to use the money
      temporarily&mdash;mind, I say only temporarily; for to my certain
      knowledge Rio Negros will pull through all right in the end&mdash;if you
      were to use it temporarily in such an emergency as this, no blame of any
      sort could possibly attach to you. The unknown benefactor won&rsquo;t mind
      whether your money&rsquo;s at your banker&rsquo;s, or employed for the
      time being in paying your debts. Your creditors will. If I were you,
      therefore, I&rsquo;d use it up in paying them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would?&rdquo; Guy inquired, glancing across at him, with a
      faint gleam of hope in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt fixed him at once with his strange cold stare, He had caught his
      man now. He could play upon him as readily as he could play his violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly I would,&rdquo; he answered, with confidence,
      striking the new chord full. &ldquo;Cyril himself would do the same in
      your place, I&rsquo;ll bet you. And the proof that he would is simply this&mdash;you
      yourself will do it. Depend upon it, if you can do anything, under given
      circumstances, Cyril would do it too, in the same set of conditions. And
      if ever Cyril feels inclined to criticise what you&rsquo;ve done, you can
      answer him back, &lsquo;I know your heart as you know mine. In my place, I
      know you&rsquo;d have acted as I did.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cyril and I are not absolutely identical,&rdquo; Guy answered
      slowly, his eyes still fixed on Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Sometimes
      I feel he does things I wouldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has more initiative than you,&rdquo; Nevitt answered, as if
      carelessly, though with deep design in his heart. &ldquo;He acts where you
      debate. You&rsquo;re often afraid to take a serious step. Cyril never
      hesitates. You draw back and falter; Cyril goes straight ahead. But all
      the more reason, accordingly, that Cyril should admit the lightness of
      whatever you do, for if you do anything&mdash;anything in the nature of a
      definite step, I mean&mdash;why, far more readily, then, would Cyril, in
      like case, have done it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he has more initiative?&rdquo; Guy asked, with a somewhat
      nettled air. He hated to be thought less individual than Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he has, my dear boy,&rdquo; Nevitt answered, smiling.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;d use the money at once, without a second&rsquo;s
      hesitation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t got the money to use,&rdquo; Guy continued,
      after a short pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cyril has, though,&rdquo; Nevitt responded, with a significant nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy perused his boots, and made no immediate answer. Nevitt wanted none
      just then; he waited some seconds, humming all the while an appropriate
      tune. Then he caught Guy&rsquo;s eye again, and fixed him a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity we don&rsquo;t know Cyril&rsquo;s address in
      Belgium,&rdquo; he said, in a musing tone. &ldquo;We might telegraph
      across for leave to use his money meanwhile. Remember, I&rsquo;m just as
      deeply compromised as you, or even more so. It&rsquo;s a pity we should
      both be ruined, with six thousand pounds standing at this very moment to
      Cyril&rsquo;s account at the London and West Country. But it can&rsquo;t
      be helped. There&rsquo;s no time to lose. The money must be paid in sharp
      by this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this evening!&rdquo; Guy exclaimed, starting up excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt nodded assent. &ldquo;Yes, by this evening, of course,&rdquo; he
      answered unperturbed, &ldquo;or we become ipso facto defaulters and
      bankrupts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a lie to be sure; but it served his purpose. Guy was a child at
      business, and believed whatever nonsense Nevitt chose to foist upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist rose and paced the room twice or thrice with a frantic air
      of unspeakable misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall lose my place at our bank, no doubt,&rdquo; Nevitt went on,
      in a resigned tone. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t much matter. Though a
      temporary loan&mdash;I could pay every penny in six weeks if I&rsquo;d
      time&mdash;a temporary loan would set things all straight again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to heaven Cyril was here,&rdquo; Guy exclaimed, in piteous
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, practically, when you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Nevitt answered,
      with a knowing smile. &ldquo;You can act as his deputy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; Guy asked, turning round upon him
      open-mouthed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt paused, and smiled sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is his cheque-book, I think,&rdquo; he replied, in the oblique
      retort, picking it up and looking at it. He tore out a cheque, as if
      pensively and by accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a precious odd thing,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that
      you showed me the other day, don&rsquo;t you know, about your signature
      and Cyril&rsquo;s being so absolutely identical.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy gazed at him in horror. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk about that!&rdquo;
      he cried, running his hand through his hair. &ldquo;If I were even to
      entertain such an idea for a moment, my self-respect would be gone for
      ever.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; Nevitt put in, with a satirical smile. &ldquo;I
      said so just now. You&rsquo;ve no initiative. Cyril wouldn&rsquo;t be
      afraid. Knowing the interests at stake, he&rsquo;d take a firm stand and
      act off-hand on his own discretion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; Guy faltered, in a hesitating voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt held him with his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I think so?&rdquo; he echoed, &ldquo;do I think so? I know it.
      Look here, Guy, you and Cyril are practically one. If Cyril were here we&rsquo;d
      ask him at once to lend us the money. If we knew where Cyril was we&rsquo;d
      telegraph across and get his leave like a bird. But as he isn&rsquo;t
      here, and as we don&rsquo;t know where he is, we must show some
      initiative; we must act for once on our own responsibility, exactly as
      Cyril would. It&rsquo;s only for six weeks. At the end of that time the
      unknown benefactor stumps up your share. You needn&rsquo;t even tell
      Cyril, if you don&rsquo;t like, of this little transaction. See! here&rsquo;s
      his cheque. You fill it in and sign it. Nobody can tell the signature isn&rsquo;t
      Cyril&rsquo;s. You take the money and release us both. In six weeks&rsquo;
      time you get your own share of the unnatural parent&rsquo;s bribe. You pay
      it in to his credit, and not a living soul on earth but ourselves need
      ever be one penny the wiser.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy tried to look away, but he couldn&rsquo;t. He couldn&rsquo;t. Nevitt
      held him fixed with his penetrating gaze. Guy moved uneasily. He felt as
      if he had a stiff neck, so hard was it to turn. Nevitt took a pen, and
      dipped it quick in the ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as an experiment,&rdquo; he said firmly, yet in a coaxing
      voice, &ldquo;sit down and sign. Let me see what it looks like. There.
      Write it just here. Write &lsquo;Cyril Waring.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy sat down as in a maze, and took the pen from his hand like an obedient
      schoolboy. For a second the pen trembled in his vacillating fingers; then
      he wrote on the cheque, in a free and flowing hand, where the signature
      ought to be, his brother&rsquo;s name. He wrote it without stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital! Capital!&rdquo; Nevitt cried in delight, looking over his
      shoulder. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a splendid facsimile! Now date and amount if
      you please. Six thousand pounds. It&rsquo;s your own natural hand after
      all. Ah, capital, capital!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Guy framed the fatal words like one dreaming or entranced, on
      the slip of paper before him. &ldquo;Pay Self or Bearer Six Thousand
      Pounds (L6,000), Cyril Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt looked at it critically. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do all right,&rdquo;
      he said, with his eye still fixed in between whiles on Guy&rsquo;s
      bloodless face. &ldquo;Now the only one thing you have still left to do

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. &mdash; MONTAGUE NEVITT FINESSES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Guy rose mechanically, and followed him to the door. Nevitt still held the
      forged cheque in his hand. Guy thought of it so to himself in plain terms,
      as the forgery. Yet somehow, he knew not why, he followed that sinister
      figure through the passage and down the stairs like one irresistibly and
      magnetically drawn forward. Why, he couldn&rsquo;t let any one go forth
      upon the streets of London&mdash;with the cheque he himself had forged in
      his hands&mdash;unwatched and unshadowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt called a cab; and jumped in, and beckoned him. Guy, still as in a
      dream, jumped after him hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the London and West Country Bank, in Lombard Street,&rdquo;
      Nevitt called through the flap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab drove off; and Guy Waring leaned back, all trembling and
      irresolute, with his head on the cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after a short drive, during which Guy&rsquo;s head seemed to be
      swimming most dreamily, they reached the bank&mdash;that crowded bank in
      Lombard Street. Nevitt thrust the cheque bodily into his companion&rsquo;s
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it in, now, and cash it,&rdquo; he said with an authoritative
      air. &ldquo;Do you hear what I say? Take it in&mdash;and cash it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy, as if impelled by some superior power, walked inside the door, and
      presented it timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cashier glanced at the sum inscribed on the cheque with no little
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rather large amount, Mr. Waring,&rdquo; he said,
      scanning his face closely. &ldquo;How will you take it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy trembled violently from head to foot as he answered, in a voice half
      choked with terror, &ldquo;Bank of England hundreds, if you please. It is
      a large sum, as you say; but I&rsquo;m placing it elsewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cashier retired for a few minutes; then he returned once more,
      bringing a big roll of notes, and a second clerk by his side&mdash;just to
      prevent mistake&mdash;stared hard at the customer. &ldquo;All square,&rdquo;
      the second clerk said, in a half-whispered aside. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him
      right enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the cashier proceeded to count out the notes with oft-wetted fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy took them up mechanically, like a drunken man, counted them over one
      by one in a strange, dazed way; and staggered out at last to the cab to
      Nevitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt leaned forward and took the bundle from his hands. Guy stood on the
      pavement and looked vacantly in at him! &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo;
      Nevitt said, clasping the bundle tight. &ldquo;Rio Negro Diamond and
      Sapphire Mines, cabby, 127, Knatchbull Street, Cheapside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabman whipped up his horse and disappeared round the corner, leaving
      Guy Waring alone&mdash;like a fool&mdash;on the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or two the dazed and dazzled journalist stood there awaking
      by degrees as from some trance or stupefaction. At first he could only
      stand still and gaze vacantly down the street after the disappearing cab;
      but as his brain cleared slowly, and the mist that hung over his mind
      dispelled itself bit by bit, he was able to walk a few steps at a time
      towards the nearest shops, where he looked in at the windows intently with
      a hollow stare, and tried to collect his scattered wits for a great effort
      at understanding this strange transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, as he looked, the full folly of his deed burst in its true
      light upon his muddled brain. He had handed Nevitt six thousand pounds in
      Bank of England notes; to waste, or lose, or speculate, or run away with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six&mdash;thousand&mdash;pounds of Cyril&rsquo;s money! Not that for one
      moment he suspected Nevitt. Guy Waring was too innocent to suspect
      anybody. But as he woke up more fully now to the nature of his own act, a
      horrible sense of guilt and pollution crept slowly over him. He put his
      hand ito his forehead. Cold sweat stood in clammy small drops upon his
      brow. Bit by bit, the hateful truth dawned clearly upon him. Nevitt had
      lured him by strange means, he knew not how, into hateful crime&mdash;into
      a disgraceful conspiracy. Word by word, the self-accusing sentence framed
      itself upon his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke it out, aloud: &ldquo;Why&mdash;this&mdash;is forgery!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dazzled and stunned by the intensity of that awful awaking from some weird
      possession or suggestion of evil by a stronger mind, Guy Waring began to
      walk on in a feverish fashion, fast, fast, oh, so fast, not knowing where
      he went, but conscious only that he must keep moving, lest an accusing
      conscience should gnaw his very heart out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whither, he hadn&rsquo;t as yet the faintest idea. His whole being for the
      moment was centred and summed up in that unspeakable remorse. He had done
      a great wrong. He had made himself a felon. And now, in the first recoil
      of his revolted nature, he must go after the man who held the evidences of
      his guilt, and by force or persuasion demand them at once from him. Those
      notes were Cyril&rsquo;s. He must get them. He must get them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possessed by this one idea, with devouring force, but still in a very
      nebulous and hazy form, Guy began walking towards the Strand and the
      Embankment, at the hot top of his speed, to get the notes back&mdash;at
      Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s chambers. He had walked with fiery zeal in that
      wrong direction for nearly a mile, his heart burning within him all the
      way, and his brain in a whirl, before it began to strike him, in a flash
      of common sense, that Montague Nevitt wouldn&rsquo;t be there at all. He
      had driven off to the office. Guy clapped his hand to his forehead once
      more, in an agony of remorse. Great heavens, what folly! He had heard him
      tell the cabman the address himself&mdash;&ldquo;127, Knatchbull Street,
      Cheapside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now he hadn&rsquo;t sense enough to hail a cab and go after him. His
      faculties were still numbed and entranced by that horrible spell of
      Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s eye. He had but one thought&mdash;to walk on, walk
      hastily. He tramped along the streets in the direction of Cheapside,
      straining every muscle to arrive at the office before Nevitt had parted
      with Cyril&rsquo;s six thousand&mdash;but he never even thought of saving
      the precious moments by driving the distance between instead of walking
      it. Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s personality still weighed down half his brain,
      and rendered his mind almost childish or imbecile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurrying on so through the crowded streets, now walking, now running, now
      pausing, now panting, knocking up here against a little knot of wayfarers,
      and delayed again there by an untimely block at some crowded crossing, he
      turned the corner at last with a beating heart into the narrow pavement of
      an alley marked up as Knatchbull Street. Number 127 was visible from afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mob of excited people marked its site by loitering about the door. Two
      policemen held off the angrier spirits among the shareholders. But,
      nothing daunted by the press, Guy forced his way in and looked around the
      room trembling, for Montague Nevitt. Too late! Too late! Nevitt wasn&rsquo;t
      there. The unhappy dupe turned to the clerk in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Montague Nevitt been here?&rdquo; he asked, in a voice all
      tremulous with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Montague Nevitt?&rdquo; the clerk responded. &ldquo;Just gone
      ten minutes ago. Came to settle Mr. Whitley&rsquo;s call&mdash;his
      brother-in-law&rsquo;s. Went off in a cab. Can I do anything for you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s paid in six thousand pounds?&rdquo; Guy gasped out
      interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk gazed at him hard with a suspicious glance. &ldquo;Are you a
      shareholder?&rdquo; he asked, with one eye on the policeman. &ldquo;What
      do you want to know for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m a shareholder, unfortunately,&rdquo; Guy answered,
      still in a maze. &ldquo;I hold three hundred original shares. My name&rsquo;s
      Guy Waring. You&rsquo;ve got me on your books. Mr. Nevitt has paid three
      thousand in Mr. Whitley&rsquo;s name, and three thousand for me. That was
      our arrangement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk glanced hard at him again. &ldquo;Waring!&rdquo; he repeated,
      turning over the leaves of his big book for further verification. &ldquo;Waring!
      Waring! Waring! Ah, here it is; Waring, Guy; journalist; 22, Staple Inn;
      300 shares. Three hundred pounds paid. Then we call up to three thousand.
      No, Mr. Nevitt didn&rsquo;t settle for you, sir. He paid Mr. Whitley&rsquo;s
      call in full. That was all. Nothing else. You&rsquo;re still our debtor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t pay up!&rdquo; Guy exclaimed, clapping his hands to
      his head, all the black guile and treachery of the man coining home to him
      at once, at one fell blow. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t pay up for me! Oh, this
      is too, too terrible!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a moment. Floods of feeling rushed over him. He knew now
      that he had committed that forgery for nothing. Cyril&rsquo;s money was
      gone. And Montague Nevitt had stolen the three thousand Guy intrusted to
      him at the bank for the second payment. Yet Guy knew he had no legal
      remedy save by acknowledging the forgery! This was almost more than human
      nature could stand. If Montague Nevitt had been by his side that moment
      Guy would have leapt at his throat, and it would have gone hard with him
      if he had left the villain living.
    </p>
    <p>
      He clapped his hands to his ears in the horror and agony of that hideous
      disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thief!&rdquo; he cried aloud, in a choking voice. &ldquo;Did he
      pay what he paid from a big roll of notes, and did he take the rest of the
      notes in the roll away with him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, just so,&rdquo; the clerk answered calmly. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t
      mention your name. But perhaps he&rsquo;s coming back by-and-by to settle
      for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy knew better. He saw through the man&rsquo;s whole black nature at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been robbed,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been robbed and deserted. I must follow the man and compel him to
      disgorge. When I&rsquo;ve got the cash back I&rsquo;ll return and pay you.
      ... No, I won&rsquo;t, though. I forgot. I&rsquo;ll take it home to the
      bank for Cyril.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk gazed at him with a smile of pitying contempt. Mad, mad; quite
      mad! The loss of his fortune had, no doubt, unhinged this shareholder&rsquo;s
      reason. But Guy, never heeding him, rushed out into the street and hailed
      a passing cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Temple Flats,&rdquo; he cried aloud, and drove to Nevitt&rsquo;s
      chambers. Too late, once more! The housekeeper told him Mr. Nevitt was
      out. He&rsquo;d just started off, portmanteau and all, as hard as a hansom
      could drive, to Waterloo Station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waterloo, then!&rdquo; Guy shouted, in wild despair, to the cabman.
      &ldquo;We must follow this man post haste. Alive or dead, I won&rsquo;t
      rest till I catch him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an unhappy phrase. In the events that came after, it was remembered
      against him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. &mdash; COLONEL KELMSCOTT&rsquo;S PUNISHMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Montague Nevitt was thus congenially engaged in pulling off his
      treble coup of settling his own share in the Rio Negro deficit, pocketing
      three thousand pounds, pro tem, for incidental expenses, and getting Guy
      Waring thoroughly into his power by his knowledge of a forgery, two other
      events were taking place elsewhere, which were destined to prove of no
      small importance to the future of the twins and their immediate
      surroundings. Things generally were converging towards a crisis in their
      affairs. Colonel Kelmscott&rsquo;s wrong-doing was bearing first-fruit
      abundantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For as soon as Granville Kelmscott received that strangely-worded note
      from Gwendoline Gildersleeve, he proceeded, as was natural, straight down,
      in his doubt, to his father&rsquo;s library. There, bursting into the
      room, with Gwendoline&rsquo;s letter still crushed in his hand in the side
      pocket of his coat, and a face like thunder, he stood in the attitude of
      avenging fate before his father&rsquo;s chair, and gazed down upon him
      angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does THIS mean?&rdquo; he asked, in a low but fuming voice,
      brandishing the note before his eyes as he spoke. &ldquo;Is every one in
      the county to be told it but I? Is everybody else to hear my business
      before you tell me a word of it? A letter comes to me this morning&mdash;no
      matter from whom&mdash;and here&rsquo;s what it says: &lsquo;I know you&rsquo;re
      not the eldest son, and that somebody else is the heir of Tilgate.&rsquo;
      Surely, if anybody was to know, <i>I</i> should have known it first.
      Surely, if I&rsquo;m to be turned adrift on the world, after being brought
      up to think myself a man of means so long, I should, at least, be turned
      adrift with my eyes open.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Kelmscott gazed at him open-mouthed with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Gwendoline Gildersleeve write that to you?&rdquo; he cried,
      overpowered at once by remorse and awe. &ldquo;Did Gwendoline Gildersleeve
      write that to you? Well, if Gwendoline Gildersleeve knows it, it&rsquo;s
      all up with the scheme! That rascally lawyer, her father, has found out
      everything. These two young men must have put their case in the fellow&rsquo;s
      hands. He must be hunting up the facts. He must be preparing to contest
      it. My boy, my boy, we&rsquo;re ruined! we&rsquo;re ruined!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These two young men,&rdquo; Granville repeated, with a puzzled air
      of surprise. &ldquo;WHAT two young men? I don&rsquo;t know them. I never
      heard of them.&rdquo; Then suddenly one of those flashes of intuition
      burst in upon him that burst in upon us all at moments of critical
      importance to our lives. &ldquo;Father, father,&rdquo; he cried, loaning
      forward in his anguish and clutching the oak chair, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
      mean to tell me those fellows, the Warings, that we met at Chetwood Court,
      are your lawful sons&mdash;and that THAT was why you bought the landscape
      with the snake in it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelmscott, of Tilgate, bent his proud head down to the table unchecked.
      &ldquo;My son, my son,&rdquo; he cried, in his despair, &ldquo;you have
      said it yourself. Your own mouth has suggested it. What use my trying to
      keep it from you any longer? These lads&mdash;are Kelmscotts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;my mother?&rdquo; Granville Kelmscott burst out, in a
      very tremulous voice. The question was almost more than a man dare ask.
      But he asked it in the first bitterness of a terrible awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother,&rdquo; Colonel Kelmscott answered, lifting his head
      once more, with a terrible effort, and looking his son point-blank in the
      face&mdash;&ldquo;your mother is just what I have always called her&mdash;my
      lawful wife&mdash;Lady Emily Kelmscott. The mother of these lads, to whom
      I was also once duly married, died before my marriage with my present wife&mdash;thank
      God I can say so. I may have acted foolishly, cruelly, criminally; but at
      least I never acted quite so basely and so ill as you impute to me,
      Granville.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven for that,&rdquo; his son answered fervently, with one
      hand on his breast, drawing a deep sigh as he spoke. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      my father, sir, and it isn&rsquo;t for me to reproach you; but if you had
      only done THAT&mdash;oh, my mother! my mother! I don&rsquo;t know, sir, I&rsquo;m
      sure, how I could ever have forgiven you; I don&rsquo;t know how I could
      ever have kept my hands off you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Kelmscott straightened himself up, and looked hard at his son. A
      terrible pathos gleamed in his proud brown eyes. His white moustache had
      more dignity than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granville,&rdquo; he said slowly, like a broken man, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      ask you to forgive me; you can never forgive me; I don&rsquo;t ask you to
      sympathise with me; a father knows better than to accept sympathy from a
      son; but I do ask you to bear with me while I try to explain myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He braced himself up, and with many long pauses, and many inarticulate
      attempts to set forth the facts in the least unfavourable aspect, told his
      story all through, in minute detail, to that hardest of all critics, his
      own dispossessed and disinherited boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re hard upon me, Granville,&rdquo; he cried at last as
      he finished, looking wistfully for pity into his son&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;you
      should remember, at least, it was for your sake I did it, my boy; it was
      for your sake I did it&mdash;yours, yours, and your mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville let him relate his whole story in full to the bitter end, though
      it was with difficulty at times that that proud and grey-haired man nerved
      himself up to tell it. Then, as soon as all was told, he looked in his
      father&rsquo;s face once more, and said slowly, with the pitilessness of
      sons in general towards the faults and failings of their erring parents&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my place to blame you, I know. You did it, I
      suppose, as you say so, for me and my mother. But it IS my place to tell
      you plainly, father, that I, for one, will have nothing at all to do with
      the fruits of your deception. I was no party to the fraud; I will be no
      party either to its results or its clearing up. I, too, have to think, as
      you say, of my mother. For her sake, I won&rsquo;t urge you to break her
      heart at once by disinheriting her son, now and here, too openly. You can
      make what arrangements you like with these blood-sucking Warings. You can
      do as you will in providing them with hush-money. Let them take their
      black-mail! You&rsquo;ve handed them over half the sum you got for
      Dowlands already, I suppose. You can buy them off for awhile by handing
      them over the remainder. Twelve thousand will do. Leeches as they are,
      that will surely content them, at least for the present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Kelmscott raised one hand and tried hard to interrupt him; but
      Granville would not be interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he went on sternly, shaking his head and frowning.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have my say for once, and then for ever keep silence.
      This is the first and last time as long as we both live I will speak with
      you on the subject. So we may as well understand one another, once and for
      ever. For my mother&rsquo;s sake, as I said, there need be just at present
      no open disclosure. You have years to live yet; and as long as you live,
      these Waring people have no claim upon the estate in any way. You&rsquo;ve
      given them as much as they&rsquo;ve any right to expect. Let them wait for
      the rest till, in the course of nature, they come into possession. As for
      me, I will go to carve out for myself a place in the world elsewhere by my
      own exertions. Perhaps, before my mother need know her son was left a
      beggar by the father who brought him up like the heir to a large estate, I
      may have been able to carve out that place for myself so well that she
      need never really feel the difference. I&rsquo;m a Kelmscott, and can
      fight the world on my own account. But, in any case, I must go. Tilgate&rsquo;s
      no longer a fit home for me. I leave it to those who have a better right
      to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose as if to depart, with the air of a man who sets forth upon the
      world to seek his fortune. Colonel Kelmscott rose too, and faced him, all
      broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granville,&rdquo; he said, in a voice scarcely audible through the
      stifled sobs he was too proud to give vent to, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not
      going like this. You&rsquo;re not going without at least shaking hands
      with your father! You&rsquo;re not going without saying good-bye to your
      mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville turned, with hot tears standing dim in his eyes&mdash;like his
      father, he was too proud to let them trickle down his cheek&mdash;and
      taking the Colonel&rsquo;s weather-beaten hand in his, wrung it silently
      for some minutes with profound emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked at the white moustache, the grizzled hair, the bright brown
      eyes suffused with answering dimness, and said, almost remorsefully,
      &ldquo;Father, good-bye. You meant me well, no doubt. You thought you were
      befriending me. But I wish to Heaven in my soul you had meant me worse. It
      would have been easier for me to bear in the end. If you&rsquo;d brought
      me up as a nobody&mdash;as a younger son&rsquo;s accustomed&mdash;&rdquo;
      He paused and drew back, for he could see his words were too cruel for
      that proud man&rsquo;s heart. Then he broke off suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I CAN&rsquo;T say good-bye to my mother,&rdquo; he went on,
      with a piteous look. &ldquo;If I tried to say good-bye to her, I must tell
      her all. I&rsquo;d break down in the attempt. I&rsquo;ll write to her from
      the Cape. It&rsquo;ll be easier so. She won&rsquo;t feel it so much then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the Cape!&rdquo; Colonel Kelmscott exclaimed, drawing back in
      horror. &ldquo;Oh, Granville, don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;re going away
      from us to Africa!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where else?&rdquo; his son asked, looking him back in the face
      steadily. &ldquo;Africa it is! That&rsquo;s the only opening left nowadays
      for a man of spirit. There, I may be able to hew out a place for myself at
      last, worthy of Lady Emily Kelmscott&rsquo;s son. I won&rsquo;t come back
      till I come back able to hold my own in the world with the best of them.
      These Warings shan&rsquo;t crow over the younger son. Good-bye, once more,
      father.&rdquo; He wrung his hand hard. &ldquo;Think kindly of me when I&rsquo;m
      gone; and don&rsquo;t forget altogether I once loved Tilgate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door and went up to his own room again. His mind was
      resolved. He wouldn&rsquo;t even say good-bye to Gwendoline Gildersleeve.
      He&rsquo;d pack a few belongings in a portmanteau in haste, and go forth
      upon the world to seek his fortune in the South African diamond fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Colonel Kelmscott sat still in the library, bowed down in his chair,
      with his head between his hands, in abject misery. A strange feeling
      seemed to throb through his weary brain; he had a sensation as though his
      skull were opening and shutting. Great veins on his forehead beat black
      and swollen. The pressure was almost more than the vessels would stand. He
      held his temples between his two palms as if to keep them from bursting.
      All ahead looked dark as night; the ground was cut from under him. The
      punishment of his sin was too heavy for him to bear. How could he ever
      tell Emily now that Granville was gone? A horrible numbness oppressed his
      brain. Oh, mercy! mercy! his head was flooded.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. &mdash; CROSS PURPOSES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the Gildersleeves&rsquo;, too, the house that day was alive with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendoline had thrown herself into a fever of alarm as soon as she had
      posted her letter to Granville Kelmscott. She went up to her own room,
      flung herself wildly on the bed, and sobbed herself into a
      half-hysterical, half-delirious state, long before dinner-time. She hardly
      knew herself at first how really ill she was. Her hands were hot and her
      forehead burning. But she disregarded such mere physical and medical
      details as those, by the side of a heart too full for utterance. She
      thought only of Granville, and of that horrid man who had threatened with
      such evident spite and rancour to ruin him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay there some hours alone, in a high fever, before her mother came up
      to her room to fetch her. Mrs. Gildersleeve was a subdued and soft-voiced
      woman, utterly crushed, so people said, by the stronger individuality of
      that blustering, domineering, headstrong man, her husband. And to say the
      truth, the eminent Q.C. had taken all the will out of her in twenty-three
      years of obedient slavery. She was pretty still, to be sure, in a certain
      faded, jaded, unassuming way; but her patient face wore a constant
      expression of suppressed terror, as if she expected every moment to be the
      victim of some terrible and unexplained exposure. And that feature at
      least in her idiosyncrasy could hardly be put down to Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s
      account; for hectoring and strong-minded as the successful Q.C. was known
      to be, nobody could for a moment accuse him in any definite way of
      deliberate unkindness to his wife or daughter. On the contrary, he was
      tender and indulgent to them to the last degree, as he understood those
      virtues. It was only by constant assertion of his own individuality, and
      constant repression or disregard of theirs, that he had broken his wife&rsquo;s
      spirit and was breaking his daughter&rsquo;s. He treated them as
      considerately as one treats a pet dog, doing everything for them that care
      and money could effect, except to admit for a moment their claim to
      independent opinions and actions of their own, or to allow the possibility
      of their thinking and feeling on any subject on earth one nail&rsquo;s
      breadth otherwise than as he himself did.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of Gwendoline, Mrs. Gildersleeve came over to the bed with a
      scared and startled air, felt her daughter&rsquo;s face tenderly with her
      hands for a moment, and then cried in alarm, &ldquo;Why, Gwennie, what&rsquo;s
      this? Your cheeks are burning! Who on earth has been here? Has that horrid
      man come down again from London to worry you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendoline looked up and tried to prevaricate. But conscience was too
      strong for her; the truth would out for all that. &ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo;
      she cried, after a pause, &ldquo;and he said, oh, he said&mdash;I could
      never tell you what dreadful things he said. But he&rsquo;s so wicked, so
      cruel! You never knew such a man! He thinks I want to marry Granville
      Kelmscott, and so he told me&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off, of a sudden,
      unable to proceed, and buried her face in her hands, sobbing long and
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did he tell you, dear?&rdquo; Mrs. Gildersleeve asked,
      with that frightened air, as of a startled wild thing, growing deeper than
      ever upon her countenance as she uttered the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me&mdash;oh, he told me&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell you what
      he told me; but he threatened to ruin us&mdash;he threatened it so
      dreadfully. It was a hateful threat. He seemed to have found out something
      that he knew would be our ruin. He frightened me to death. I never heard
      any one say such things as he did.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gildersleeve drew back in profound agitation. &ldquo;Found out
      something that would be our ruin!&rdquo; she cried, with white face all
      aghast. &ldquo;Oh, Gwennie, what do you mean? Didn&rsquo;t he tell you
      what it was? Didn&rsquo;t he try to explain to you? He&rsquo;s a wicked,
      wicked man&mdash;so cruel, so unscrupulous! He gets one&rsquo;s secrets
      into his hands, by underhand means, and then uses them to make one do
      whatever he chooses. I see how it is. He wants to force us into letting
      him marry you&mdash;into making you marry him! Oh, Gwennie, this is hard.
      Didn&rsquo;t he tell you at all what it was he knew? Didn&rsquo;t he give
      you a hint what sort of secret he was driving at?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendoline looked up once more, and murmured low through her sobs, &ldquo;No,
      he didn&rsquo;t say what it was. He&rsquo;s too cunning for that. But I
      think&mdash;I think it was something about Granville. Mother, I never told
      you, but you know I love him! I think it was something about HIM, though I
      can&rsquo;t quite make sure. Some secret about somebody not being properly
      married, or something of that sort. I didn&rsquo;t quite understand. You
      see, he was so discreetly vague and reticent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gildersleeve drew back her face all aghast with horror. &ldquo;Some
      secret&mdash;about somebody&mdash;not being properly married!&rdquo; she
      repeated slowly, with wild terror in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; Gwendoline gasped out, with an effort once
      more. &ldquo;It was about somebody not being really the proper heir; he
      made me promise I wouldn&rsquo;t tell; but I don&rsquo;t know how to keep
      it. He was immensely full of it; it was an awful secret; and he said he
      would ruin us&mdash;ruin us ruthlessly. He said we were in his power, and
      he&rsquo;d crush us under his heel. And, oh, when he said it, you should
      have seen his face. It was horrible, horrible. I&rsquo;ve seen nothing
      else since. It dogs me&mdash;it haunts me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gildersleeve sat down by the bedside wringing her hands in silence.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to-night,&rdquo; she said at last, after a long
      deep pause, and in a voice like a woman condemned to death, &ldquo;too
      late to do anything; but to-morrow your father must go up to town and try
      to see him. At all costs we must buy him off. He knows everything&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      clear. He&rsquo;ll ruin us. He&rsquo;ll ruin us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use papa going up to town, though,&rdquo; Gwendoline
      answered half dreamily. &ldquo;That dreadful man said he was going away
      for his holiday to the country at once. He&rsquo;ll be gone to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone? Gone where?&rdquo; Mrs. Gildersleeve cried, in the same
      awestruck voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Devonshire,&rdquo; Gwendoline replied, shutting her eyes hard
      and still seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gildersleeve echoed the phrase in a startled cry. &ldquo;To
      Devonshire, Gwendoline! To Devonshire! Did he say to Devonshire?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Gwendoline went on slowly, trying to recall his very
      words. &ldquo;To the skirts of Dartmoor, I think he said; to a place in
      the wilds by the name of Mambury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mambury!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The terror and horror that frail and faded woman threw into the one word
      fairly startled Gwendoline. She opened her eyes and stared aghast at her
      mother. And well she might, for the effect was electrical. Mrs.
      Gildersleeve was sitting there, transfixed with awe and some unspeakable
      alarm; her figure was rigid; her face was dead white; her mouth was drawn
      down with a convulsive twitch; she clasped her bloodless hands on her
      knees in mute agony. For a moment she sat there like a statue of flesh.
      Then, as sense and feeling came back to her by slow degrees, she could but
      rock her body up and down in her chair with a short swaying motion, and
      mutter over and over again to herself in that same appalled and terrified
      voice, &ldquo;Mambury&mdash;Mambury&mdash;Mambury&mdash;Mambury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the name, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Gwendoline went on,
      almost equally alarmed. &ldquo;On a hunt after records, he said; on a hunt
      after records. Whatever it was he wanted to prove, I suppose he knew that
      was the place to prove it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gildersleeve rose, or to speak with more truth, staggered slowly to
      her feet, and, steadying herself with an effort, made blindly for the
      door, groping her way as she went, like some faint and wounded creature.
      She said not a word to Gwendoline. She had no tongue left for speech or
      comment. She merely stepped on, pale and white, pale and white, like one
      who walks in her sleep, and clutched the door-handle hard to keep her from
      falling. Gwendoline, now thoroughly alarmed, followed her close on her way
      to the top of the stairs. There Mrs. Gildersleeve paused, turned round to
      her daughter with a mute look of anguish and held up one hand, palm
      outward, appealingly, as if on purpose to forbid her from following
      farther. At the gesture, Gwendoline fell back, and looked after her mother
      with straining eyes. Mrs. Gildersleeve staggered on, erect, yet to all
      appearance almost incapable of motion, and stumbled down the stairs, and
      across the hall, and into the drawing-room opposite. The rest Gwendoline
      neither saw, nor heard, nor guessed at. She crept back into her own room,
      and, flinging herself on her bed alone as she stood, cried still more
      piteously and miserably than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in the drawing-room, however, Mrs. Gildersleeve found the famous Q.C.
      absorbed in the perusal of that day&rsquo;s paper. She came across towards
      him, pale as a ghost, and with ashen lips. &ldquo;Gilbert,&rdquo; she said
      slowly, blurting it all out in her horror, without one word of warning,
      &ldquo;that dreadful man Nevitt has seen Gwennie again, and he&rsquo;s
      told her he knows all, and he means to ruin us, and he&rsquo;s heard of
      the marriage, and he&rsquo;s gone down to Mambury to hunt up the records!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The eminent Q.C. let the paper drop from his huge red hands in the
      intensity of his surprise, while his jaw fell in unison at so startling
      and almost incredible a piece of intelligence. &ldquo;Nevitt knows all!&rdquo;
      he exclaimed, half incredulous. &ldquo;He means to ruin us! And he told
      this to Gwendoline! Gone down to Mambury! Oh no, Minnie, impossible! You
      must have made some mistake. What did she say exactly? Did she mention
      Mambury?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said it exactly as I&rsquo;ve said it now to you,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Gildersleeve persisted with a stony stare. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone down to
      Devonshire, she said; to the borders of Dartmoor, on a hunt after the
      records; to a place in the wilds by the name of Mambury. Those were her
      very words. I could stake my life on each syllable. I give them to you
      precisely as she gave them to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gildersleeve gazed across at her with the countenance which had made
      so many a nervous witness quake at the Old Bailey. &ldquo;Are you QUITE
      sure of that, Minnie?&rdquo; he asked, in his best cross-examining tone.
      &ldquo;Quite sure she said Mambury, all of her own accord? Quite sure you
      didn&rsquo;t suggest it to her, or supply the name, or give her a hint of
      its whereabouts, or put her a leading question?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it likely I&rsquo;d suggest it to her?&rdquo; the meekest of
      women answered, aroused to retort for once, and with her face like a
      sheet. &ldquo;Is it likely I&rsquo;d tell her? Is it likely I&rsquo;d give
      my own girl the clue? She said it all of herself, I tell you, without one
      word of prompting. She said it just as I repeated it&mdash;to a place in
      the wilds by the name of Mambury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Gildersleeve whistled inaudibly to himself. &lsquo;Twas his way
      when he felt himself utterly nonplussed. This was very strange news. He
      didn&rsquo;t really understand it. But he rose and confronted his wife
      anxiously. That overbearing big man was evidently stirred by this untoward
      event to the very depths of his nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Gwennie knows all!&rdquo; he cried, the blood rushing purple
      into his ruddy flushed cheeks. &ldquo;The wretch! The brute! He must have
      told her everything!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gilbert,&rdquo; his wife answered, sinking into a chair in her
      horror, &ldquo;even HE couldn&rsquo;t do that&mdash;not to my own very
      daughter! And he didn&rsquo;t do it, I&rsquo;m sure. He didn&rsquo;t dare&mdash;coward
      as he is, he couldn&rsquo;t be quite so cowardly. She doesn&rsquo;t guess
      what it means. She thinks it&rsquo;s something, I believe, about Granville
      Kelmscott. She&rsquo;s in love with young Kelmscott, as I told you long
      ago, and everything to her mind takes some colour from that fancy. I don&rsquo;t
      think it ever occurred to her, from what she says, this has anything at
      all to do with you or me, Gilbert.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Q.C. reflected. He saw at once he was in a tight corner. That
      boisterous man, with the burly big hands, looked quite subdued and
      crestfallen now. He could hardly have snubbed the most unassuming junior.
      This was a terrible thing, indeed, for a man so unscrupulous and clever as
      Montague Nevitt to have wormed out of the registers. How he could ever
      have wormed it out Gilbert Gildersleeve hadn&rsquo;t the faintest idea,
      Why, who on earth could have shown him the entry of that fatal marriage&mdash;Minnie&rsquo;s
      first marriage&mdash;the marriage with that wretch who died in Portland
      prison&mdash;the marriage that was celebrated at St. Mary&rsquo;s, at
      Mambury? He couldn&rsquo;t for a moment conceive, for nobody but
      themselves, he fondly imagined, had ever identified Mrs. Gilbert
      Gildersleeve, the wife of the eminent Q.C., with that unhappy Mrs. Read,
      the convict&rsquo;s widow. The convict&rsquo;s widow. Ah, there was the
      rub. For she was really a widow in name alone when Gilbert Gildersleeve
      married her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Montague Nevitt, that human ferret, with his keen sharp eyes, and his
      sleek polite ways, had found it all out in spite of them&mdash;had hunted
      up the date of Read&rsquo;s death and their marriage, and had bragged how
      he was going down to Mambury to prove it!
    </p>
    <p>
      All the Warings and Reads always got married at Widdicombe or Mambury.
      There were lots of them on the books there, that was one comfort, anyhow.
      He&rsquo;d have a good search to find his needle in such a pottle of hay.
      But to think the fellow should have, had the double-dyed cruelty to break
      the shameful secret first of all to Gwendoline! That was his vile way of
      trying to force a poor girl into an unwilling consent. Gilbert
      Gildersleeve lifted his burly big hands in front of his capacious
      waistcoat, and pressed them together angrily. If only he had that rascal&rsquo;s
      throat well between them at that moment! He&rsquo;d crush the fellow&rsquo;s
      windpipe till he choked him on the spot, though he answered for it before
      the judges of assize to-morrow!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing possible for it, Minnie,&rdquo; he
      said at last, drawing a long deep breath. &ldquo;I must go down to Mambury
      to-morrow to be beforehand with him. And I must either buy him off; or
      else, if that won&rsquo;t do&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or else what, Gilbert?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She trembled like an aspen leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or else get at the books in the vestry myself,&rdquo; the Q.C.
      muttered low between his clenched teeth, &ldquo;before the fellow has time
      to see them and prove it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. &mdash; GUY IN LUCK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Guy Waring reached Waterloo ten minutes too late. Nevitt had gone on by
      the West of England express. The porter at the labelling place &ldquo;minded
      the gentleman well.&rdquo; He was a sharp-looking gentleman, with a queer
      look about the eyes, and a dark moustache curled round at the corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Guy cried eagerly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s him right
      enough. The eyes mark the man. And where was he going to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had his things labelled,&rdquo; the porter said, &ldquo;for
      Plymouth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when does the next train start?&rdquo; Guy inquired, all on
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter, consulting the time-table in the muddle-headed way peculiar to
      railway porters, and stroking his chin with his hand to assist
      cerebration, announced, after a severe internal struggle, that the 3.45
      down, slow, was the earliest train available.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for it then, Guy perceived, but to run home to his
      rooms, possessing his soul in patience, pack up a few things in his
      Gladstone bag, and return at his leisure to catch the down train thus
      unfavourably introduced to his critical notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Guy had dared, to be sure, he might have gone straight to a
      police-station, and got an inspector to telegraph along the line to stop
      the thief with his booty at Basingstoke or Salisbury. But Guy didn&rsquo;t
      dare. For to interfere with Nevitt now by legal means would be to risk the
      discovery of his own share in the forgery. And from that risk the startled
      and awakened young man shrank for a thousand reasons; though the chief
      among them all was certainly one that never would have occurred to any one
      but himself as even probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t wish Elma Clifford to know that the man she loved, and the
      man who loved her, had become that day a forger&rsquo;s brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, he had only seen Elma once&mdash;that afternoon at the Holkers&rsquo;
      garden-party. But, as Cyril himself knew, he had fallen in love with her
      at first sight&mdash;far more immediately, indeed, than even Cyril himself
      had done. Blood, as usual, was thicker than water. The points that
      appealed to one brother appealed also to the other, but with this
      characteristic difference, that Guy, who was the more emotional and less
      strong-willed of the two, yielded himself up at the very first glance to
      the beautiful stranger, while Cyril required some further acquaintance
      before quite giving way and losing his heart outright to her. And from
      that first meeting forward, Guy had carried Elma Clifford&rsquo;s image
      engraved upon his memory&mdash;as he would carry it, he believed, to his
      dying day. Not, to be sure, that he ever thought for a moment of
      endeavouring to win her away from his brother. She was Cyril&rsquo;s
      discovery, and to Cyril, therefore, he yielded her up, as of prior right,
      though with a pang of reluctance. But now that he stood face to face at
      last with his own accomplished crime, the first thought that rose in his
      mind spontaneous was for Elma&rsquo;s happiness. He must never let Elma
      Clifford know that the man she loved, and would doubtless marry, was now
      by HIS act&mdash;a forger&rsquo;s brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three forty-five arrived at last, and Guy set off, all trembling, on his
      fatal quest. As he sped along, indignant at heart with Nevitt&rsquo;s
      black treachery, on the line to Plymouth, he had plenty of time to revolve
      these things abundantly in his own soul. And when, after a long and dusty
      drive, he reached Plymouth, late at night, he could learn nothing for the
      moment about Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s movements. So he was forced to go
      quietly for the evening to the Duke of Devonshire Hotel, and there wait as
      best he might to see how events would next develop themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day passed away&mdash;two days&mdash;but nothing turned up. Guy wasted
      much time in Plymouth making various inquiries before he learnt at last
      that a man with a queer look about the eyes, and a moustache with waxed
      ends, had gone down a night or so earlier by the other line to a station
      at the foot of Dartmoor, by the name of Mambury.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner, however, had he learnt this promising news, than he set off at
      once, hot at heart as ever, to pursue the robber. That wretch shouldn&rsquo;t
      get away scot free with his booty; Guy would follow him and denounce him
      to the other end of the universe! When he reached Mambury, he went direct
      to the village inn and asked, with trembling lips, if Mr. Montague Nevitt
      was at present staying there. The landlord shook his head with a stubborn,
      rustic negative. &ldquo;No, we arn&rsquo;t a-got no gentleman o&rsquo;
      thik there name in the house,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;fact is, zur, to tell
      &lsquo;ee the truth, we arn&rsquo;t a-had nobody stoppin&rsquo; in the
      Arms at all lately, &lsquo;cep&rsquo; it might be a gentleman come down
      from London, an&rsquo; it was day afore yesterday as he did come, an&rsquo;
      he do call &lsquo;unself McGregor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick as lightning, Guy suspected Nevitt might be passing under a false
      name. What more likely, indeed, seeing he had made off with Guy&rsquo;s
      three thousand pounds?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what sort of a man is this McGregor?&rdquo; he asked hastily,
      putting his suspicion into shape. &ldquo;What age? What height? What kind
      of a person to look at?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wull, he&rsquo;s a vine upstandin&rsquo; zart of a gentleman,&rdquo;
      the landlord answered glibly in his own dialect; &ldquo;as proper a
      gentleman as you&rsquo;d wish to zee in a day&rsquo;s march; med be about
      your height, zur, or a trifle more, has his moustaches curled round zame
      as if it med be a bellick&rsquo;s harns; an&rsquo; a strange zart o&rsquo;
      a look about his eyes, too, as if ur could zee right drew an&rsquo; drew
      &lsquo;ee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; Guy exclaimed, with a start, in profound
      excitement. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fellow, sure enough. I know him. I
      know him. And where is he now, landlord? Is he in the house? Can I see
      him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, &lsquo;ee can&rsquo;t zee him, zur,&rdquo; the landlord
      answered, eyeing the stranger askance; &ldquo;he be out, jest at present.
      He do go vur a walk, mostly, down yonner in the bottom alongside the
      brook. Mebbe if you was to vollow by river-bank you med come up wi&rsquo;
      him by-an&rsquo;-by ... and mebbe, agin, you medn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow him,&rdquo; Guy exclaimed, growing more excited
      than ever, now this quarry was almost well within sight; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      follow him till I find him, the confounded rascal. I&rsquo;ll follow him
      to his grave. He shan&rsquo;t get away from me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord looked at him with a dubious frown. That one could smile and
      smile and be a villain didn&rsquo;t enter into his simple rustic
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a pleasant-spoken gentleman is Maister McGregor,&rdquo;
      the honest Devonian said, with a tinge of disapprobation in his thick
      voice. &ldquo;What vur do &lsquo;ee want to vind &lsquo;un? That&rsquo;s
      what <i>I</i> wants to know. He don&rsquo;t look like one as did ever hurt
      a vlea. Such a soft zart of a voice. An&rsquo; he do play on the viddle
      that beautiful&mdash;that beautiful, why, &lsquo;tis the zame if he war a
      angel from heaven. Viddler Moore, he wur up here wi&rsquo; his music last
      night; an&rsquo; Maister McGregor, he took the instrument vrom un, an&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Let ME have a try, my vrend,&rsquo; says he, all modest and
      unassoomin&rsquo;; and vi&rsquo; that, he wounded it up, an&rsquo; he
      begun to play. Lard, how he did play. Never heard nothing like it in all
      my barn days. It is the zame, vor all the world, as you do hear they
      viddler chaps that plays by themselves in the Albert Hall up to London.
      Depend upon it, zur, there ain&rsquo;t no harm in HIM. A vullow as can
      play on the viddle like thik there, why, he couldn&rsquo;t do no hurt, not
      to child nor chicken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy turned away from the door, fretting and fuming inwardly. He knew
      better than that. Nevitt&rsquo;s consummate mastery of his chosen
      instrument was but of a piece, after all, with the way he could play on
      all the world, as on a familiar gamut. It was the very skill of the man
      that made him so dangerous and so devilish. Guy felt that under the spell
      of Nevitt&rsquo;s eye he himself was but as clay in the hands of the
      potter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Nevitt should never so trick him and twist him again. To that his mind
      was now fully made up. He would never let that cold eye hold him fixed as
      of yore by its steely glance. Once for all, Nevitt had proved his power
      too well. Guy would take good care he never subjected himself in future to
      that uncanny influence. One forgery was enough. Henceforth he was adamant.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet? And yet he was going to seek out Nevitt; going to stand face to
      face with that smiling villain again; going to tax him with his crime;
      going to ask him what he meant by this double-dyed treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord had told him where Nevitt was most likely to be found. He
      followed that direction. At a gate that turned by the river-bank, twenty
      minutes from the inn, a small boy was seated. He was a Devonshire boy of
      the poorest moorland type, short, squat, and thick set. As Guy reached the
      gate, the boy rose and opened it, pulling his forelock twice or thrice,
      expectant of a ha&rsquo;penny. &ldquo;Has anybody gone down here?&rdquo;
      Guy asked, in an excited voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the boy answered promptly, &ldquo;Yes, thik there gentleman, what&rsquo;s
      stoppin&rsquo; at the Talbot Arms. And another gentleman, too; o&rsquo;ny
      t&rsquo;other one come after and went t&rsquo;other way round. A big zart
      o&rsquo; a gentleman wi&rsquo; &lsquo;ands vit vor two. He axed me the
      zame question, had anybody gone by. This is dree of &lsquo;ee as has come
      zince I&rsquo;ve been a zitting here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy paid no attention to the second-named gentleman, with the hands fit
      for two, or to his inquiries after who might have gone before him. He
      fastened at once on the really important and serious information that the
      person who was stopping at the Talbot Arms had shortly before turned down
      the side footpath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, my boy,&rdquo; he said, tossing the lad sixpence, the
      first coin he came across in his waistcoat pocket. The boy opened his eyes
      wide, and pocketed it with a grin. So unexpected a largess sufficed to
      impress the handsome stranger firmly on his memory. He didn&rsquo;t forget
      him when a few days later he was called on to give evidence&mdash;at a
      coroner&rsquo;s inquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Guy, unsuspicious of the harm he had done himself, walked on, all on
      fire, down the woodland path. It was a shady path, and it led through a
      deep dell arched with hazels on every side, while a little brawling brook
      ran along hard by, more heard than seen, in the bottom of the dingle.
      Thick bramble obscured the petty rapids from view and half trailed their
      lush shoots here and there across the pathway. It was just such a mossy
      spot as Cyril would have loved to paint; and Guy, himself half an artist
      by nature, would in any other mood have paused to gaze delighted on its
      tangled greenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, however, he was in no mood to loiter long over ferns and
      mosses. He walked down that narrow way, where luxuriant branches of fresh
      green blackberry bushes encroached upon the track, still seething in soul,
      and full of the bitter wrong inflicted upon him by the man he had till
      lately considered his dearest friend. At each bend of the footpath, as it
      threaded its way through the tortuous dell, following close the elbows of
      the bickering little stream, he expected to come full in sight of Nevitt.
      But, gaze as he would, no Nevitt appeared. He must have gone on, Guy
      thought, and come out at the other end, into the upland road, of which the
      porters at Mambury Station had told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he arrived at a delicious green nook, where the shade of the trees
      overhead was exceptionally dense, and where the ferns by the side were
      somewhat torn and trodden. Casting his eye on the ground to the left, a
      metal clasp, gleaming silvery among the bracken, happened to attract his
      cursory attention. Something about that clasp looked strangely familiar.
      He paused and stared hard at it. Surely, surely he had seen those metal
      knobs before. A flash of recognition ran electric through his brain. Why,
      yes; it was the fastener of Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s pocket-book&mdash;the
      pocket-book in which he carried his most private documents; the
      pocket-book that must have held Cyril&rsquo;s stolen six thousand. Guy
      stooped down to pick it up with a whirling sense of surprise. Great
      heavens! what was this? Not only the clasp, but the pocket-book itself&mdash;the
      pocket-book filled full and crammed to bursting with papers. Ah, mercy,
      what papers? Yes, incredible&mdash;the money! Hundred-pound notes! Not a
      doubt upon earth of it. The whole of the stolen and re-stolen three
      thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or two Guy stood there, unable to believe his own swimming
      eyes. What on earth could have happened? Was it chance or design? Had
      Nevitt deliberately thrown away his ill-gotten gains? Were detectives on
      the track? Was he anxious to conceal his part in the theft? Had remorse
      got the better of him? Or was he frightened at last, thinking Guy was on
      his way to recover and restore Cyril&rsquo;s stolen property?
    </p>
    <p>
      But no, the pocket-book was neither hidden in the ferns nor yet studiously
      thrown away. From the place where it lay, Guy felt confident at once it
      had fallen unperceived from Nevitt&rsquo;s pocket, and been trodden by his
      heel unawares into the yielding leaf-mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he pulled it out accidentally with his handkerchief? Very likely, Guy
      thought. But then, how strange and improbable that a man so methodical and
      calculating as Nevitt should carry such valuable belongings as those in
      the self-same pocket. It was certainly most singular. However, Guy
      congratulated himself, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, that so much at least
      of the stolen property was duly recovered. He could pay back one-half of
      the purloined sum now to Cyril&rsquo;s credit. So he went on his way
      through the rest of the wood in a somewhat calmer and easier frame of
      mind. To be sure, he had still to hunt down that villain Nevitt, and to
      tax him to his face with his double-dyed treachery. But it was something,
      nevertheless, to have recovered a part, at any rate, of the stolen money.
      And Nevitt himself need never know by what fortunate accident he had
      happened to recover it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He emerged on the upland road, and struck back towards Mambury. All the
      way round, he never saw his man. Weary with walking, he returned in the
      end to the Talbot Arms. Had Mr. McGregor come back? No, not yet; but he
      was sure to be home for dinner. Then Guy would wait, and dine at the inn
      as well. He might have to stop all night, but he must see McGregor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day wore on, however, it became gradually clear to him that
      Montague Nevitt didn&rsquo;t mean to return at all. Hour after hour passed
      by, but nothing was heard of him. The landlord, good man, began to express
      his doubts and fears most freely. He hoped no harm hadn&rsquo;t come to
      the gentleman in the parlour; he had a powerful zight o&rsquo; money on un
      for a man to carry about; the landlord had zeen it when he took out his
      book from his pocket to pay the porter. Volks didn&rsquo;t ought to go
      about with two or dree hundred pound or more in the lonely lanes on the
      edge of the moorland.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Guy, for his part, put a different interpretation on the affair at
      once. In some way or other Montague Nevitt, he thought, must have found
      out he was being tracked, and, fearing for his safety, must have dropped
      the pocket-book and made off, without note or notice given, on his own
      sound legs, for some other part of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Guy made up his mind to return next morning by the very first train
      direct to Plymouth, and there inquire once more whether anything further
      had been seen of the noticeable stranger.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. &mdash; A SLIGHT MISUNDERSTANDING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the very same day that Guy Waring visited Mambury, where his mother was
      married, Montague Nevitt had hunted up the entry of Colonel Kelmscott&rsquo;s
      wedding in the church register.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevitt&rsquo;s behaviour, to say the truth, wasn&rsquo;t quite so black as
      Guy Waring painted it. He had gone off with the extra three thousand in
      his pocket, to be sure; but he didn&rsquo;t intend to appropriate it
      outright to his own uses. He merely meant to give Guy a thoroughly good
      fright, as it wasn&rsquo;t really necessary the call should be met for
      another fortnight; and then, as soon as he&rsquo;d found out the truth
      about Colonel Kelmscott and his unacknowledged sons, he proposed to use
      his knowledge of the forgery as a lever with Guy, so as to force him to
      come to advantageous terms with his supposed father. Nevitt&rsquo;s idea
      was that Guy and Cyril should drive a hard bargain on their own account
      with the Colonel, and that he himself should then receive a handsome
      commission on the transaction from both the brothers, under penalty of
      disclosing the true facts about the cheque by whose aid Guy had met their
      joint liability to the Rio Negro Diamond Mines.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with no small joy, therefore, that Nevitt saw at last in the parish
      register of St. Mary&rsquo;s at Mambury, the interesting announcement,
      &ldquo;June 27th, Henry Lucius Kelmscott, of the parish of Plymouth,
      bachelor, private in the Regiment of Scots Greys, to Lucy Waring,
      spinster, of this parish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw at a glance, of course, why Kelmscott of Tilgate had chosen to
      describe himself in this case as a private soldier. But he also saw that
      the entry was an official document, and that here he had one firm hold the
      more on Colonel Kelmscott, who must falsely have sworn to that incorrect
      description. The great point of all, however, was the signature to the
      book; and though nearly thirty years had elapsed since those words were
      written, it was clear to Nevitt, when he compared the autograph in the
      register with one of Colonel Kelmscott&rsquo;s recent business letters,
      brought with him for the purpose, that both had been penned by one and the
      same person.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled to himself with delight to think how great a benefactor he had
      proved himself unawares to Guy and Cyril. At that very moment, no doubt,
      his misguided young friend whom he had compelled to assist him with the
      sinews of war for this important campaign was reviling and objurating him
      in revengeful terms as the blackest and most infamous of double-dyed
      traitors. Ah, well! ah, well! the good are inured to gross ingratitude.
      Guy little knew, as he, Montague Nevitt, stood there triumphant in the
      vestry, blandly rewarding the expectant clerk for his pains with a whole
      Bank of England five-pound note&mdash;the largest sum that functionary had
      ever in his life received all at once in a single payment&mdash;Guy little
      knew that Nevitt was really the chief friend and founder of the family
      fortunes, and was prepared to compel the &ldquo;unknown benefactor&rdquo;
      (for a moderate commission) to recognise his unacknowledged firstborn sons
      before all the world as the heirs to Tilgate. But yesterday, they were
      nameless waifs and strays, of uncertain origin, ashamed of their birth,
      and ignorant even whether they had been duly begotten in lawful wedlock;
      to-day, they were the legal inheritors of an honoured name and a great
      estate, the first and foremost among the landed gentry of a wealthy and
      beautiful English county.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled to think what a good turn he had done unawares to those
      ungrateful youths&mdash;and how little credit, as yet, they were prepared
      to give him for it. In such a mood he returned to the inn to lunch. His
      spirits were high. This was a good day&rsquo;s work, and he could afford,
      indeed, to make merry with his host over it. He ordered in a bottle of
      wine&mdash;such wine as the little country cellar could produce, and
      invited that honest man, the landlord, to step in and share it with him.
      He had tasted worse sherry on London dinner-tables, and he told his host
      so. An affable man with inferiors, Mr. Montague Nevitt! Then he strolled
      out by himself down the path by the brook. It was a pleasant walk, with
      the water making music in little trickles by its side, and Montague
      Nevitt, as a man of taste, found it suited exactly with his temper for the
      moment. He noted an undercurrent of rejoicing and triumphant cheeriness in
      the tone of the stream as it plashed among the pebbles on its precipitous
      bed that suggested to his mind some bars of a symphony which he determined
      to compose as soon as he got home again to his beloved fiddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he walked along by himself, elate, and with a springy step, on thoughts
      of ambition intent, till he came at last to a cool and shadowy place,
      where as yet the ferns were NOT broken down and trampled underfoot, though
      Guy Waring found them so some twenty minutes later.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that spot he looked up, and saw advancing along the path in the
      opposite direction the burly figure of a man, in a light tourist suit,
      whom he hadn&rsquo;t yet observed since he came to Mambury. The very first
      point he noticed about the man, long before he recognised him, was a pair
      of overgrown, obtrusive hands held somewhat awkwardly in front of him&mdash;just
      like Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s. The likeness, indeed, was so
      ridiculously close that Montague Nevitt smiled quietly to himself to
      observe it. If he&rsquo;d been in the Tilgate district now, he&rsquo;d
      have declared, without the slightest hesitation, that the man on the path
      WAS Gilbert Gildersleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      One second later, he pulled himself up with a jerk in alarmed surprise.
      &ldquo;Great heavens&rdquo; he cried to himself, a weird sense of awe
      creeping over him piece-meal, &ldquo;either this is a dream or else it IS,
      it must be Gilbert Gildersleeve.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, indeed, it was. Gilbert Gildersleeve himself, in his proper
      person. But the eminent Q.C., better versed in the wiles of time and place
      than Guy Waring in his innocence, had not come obtrusively to Mambury
      village or asked point-blank at the Talbot Arms by his own right name for
      the man he was in search of. Such simplicity of procedure would never even
      have occurred to that practised hand at the Old Bailey. Mr. Gilbert
      Gildersleeve appeared on that woodland path in the general guise of the
      common pedestrian tourist with his head-quarters at Ivybridge, walking
      about on the congenial outskirts of the Moor in search of the picturesque,
      and coming and going by mere accident through Mambury. He had hovered
      around the neighbourhood for two days, off and on, in search of his man;
      and now, by careful watching, like an amateur detective, he had run his
      prey to earth by a dexterous flank-movement and secured an interview with
      him where he couldn&rsquo;t shirk or avoid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Montague Nevitt, however, the meeting seemed at first sight but the
      purest accident. He had no reason to suppose, indeed, that Gilbert
      Gildersleeve had any special interest in his visit to Mambury, further
      than might be implied in its possible connection with Granville Kelmscott&rsquo;s
      affairs; and he didn&rsquo;t believe Gwendoline, in her fear of her
      father, that blustering man, would ever have communicated to him the
      personal facts of their interview at Tilgate. So he advanced to meet his
      old acquaintance, the barrister, with frankly outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gildersleeve!&rdquo; he exclaimed in some surprise. &ldquo;No,
      it can&rsquo;t be you. Well, this IS indeed an unexpected pleasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Gildersleeve gazed down upon him from the towering elevation of
      his six feet four. Montague Nevitt was tall enough, as men go in England,
      but with his slim, tailor-made form, and his waxed moustaches, he looked
      by the side of that big-built giant, like a Bond Street exquisite before
      some prize-fighting Goliath. The barrister didn&rsquo;t hold out his huge
      hand in return. On the contrary, he concealed it, as far as was possible,
      behind his burly back, and, looking down from the full height of his
      contempt upon the sinister smirking creature who advanced to greet him
      with that false smile on his face, he asked severely,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are YOU doing here? That&rsquo;s what <i>I</i> have to ask.
      What foxy ferreting have you come down to Mambury for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foxy ferreting,&rdquo; Montague Nevitt repeated, drawing back as if
      stung, and profoundly astonished. &ldquo;Why, what do you mean by that,
      Mr. Gildersleeve? I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo; The home-thrust was
      too true&mdash;after the great cross-examiner&rsquo;s well-known bullying
      manner&mdash;not to pierce him to the quick. &ldquo;Who dares to say I go
      anywhere ferreting?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> do,&rdquo; Gilbert Gildersleeve answered, with assured
      confidence. &ldquo;I say it, and I know it. You pitiful sneak, don&rsquo;t
      deny it to ME. You were in the vestry this morning looking up the
      registers. Even YOU, with your false eyes, sir, daren&rsquo;t look me in
      the face and tell me you weren&rsquo;t. I saw you there myself. And I know
      you found in the books what you wanted; for you paid the clerk an
      extravagant fee. ... What&rsquo;s that? you rat, don&rsquo;t try to
      interrupt me. Don&rsquo;t try to bully me. It never succeeds. Montague
      Nevitt, I tell you, I WON&rsquo;T be bullied.&rdquo; And the great Q.C.
      put his foot down on the path with an elephantine solidity that made the
      prospect of bullying him seem tolerably unlikely. &ldquo;I know the facts,
      and I&rsquo;ll stand no prevarication. Now, tell me, what vile use did you
      mean to make of your discovery this morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague Nevitt drew back, fairly nonplussed for the moment by such a
      vigorous and unexpected attack on his flank. Resourceful as he was, even
      his cunning mind came wholly unprepared to this sudden cross-questioning.
      He felt his own physical inferiority to the big Q.C. more keenly just then
      than he could ever have conceived it possible for a man of his type to
      feel it. After all, mind doesn&rsquo;t always triumph over matter.
      Montague Nevitt was aware that that mountain of a man, with his six feet
      four of muscular humanity, fairly cowed and overawed him at such very
      close quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what business it is of yours, Mr. Gildersleeve,&rdquo;
      he murmured, in a somewhat apologetic voice. &ldquo;I may surely be
      allowed to hunt up questions of pedigree, of service in the end to myself
      and my friends, without YOUR interference.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Gildersleeve glared at him, and flared up all at once with
      righteous indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of service in the end to yourself and your friends!&rdquo; he
      cried, with unfeigned scorn, putting his own interpretation, as was
      natural, on the words. &ldquo;Why, you cur! you reptile! you unblushing
      sneak! Do you mean to say openly you avow your intention of threatening
      and blackmailing me? here&mdash;alone&mdash;to my face! You extortionate
      wretch! I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed even YOU in your heart would
      descend to such meanness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague Nevitt, flurried and taken aback as he was, yet reflected vaguely
      with some wonder, as he listened and looked, what this sudden passion of
      disinterested zeal could betoken. Why such burning solicitude for Colonel
      Kelmscott&rsquo;s estate on the part of a man who was his avowed enemy?
      Even if Gwendoline meant to marry the young fellow Granville, with her
      father&rsquo;s consent, how could Nevitt himself levy blackmail upon
      Gilbert Gildersleeve by his knowledge of the two Warings&rsquo; claim to
      the property? A complication surely. Was there not some unexpected
      intricacy here which the cunning schemer himself didn&rsquo;t yet
      understand, but which might redound, if unravelled, to his greater
      advantage?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blackmail YOU, Mr. Gildersleeve,&rdquo; he cried, with a
      righteously indignant air. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an ugly word. I blackmail
      nobody; and least of all the father of a lady whom I still regard, in
      spite of all she can say or do to make my life a blank, with affection and
      respect as profound as ever. How can my inquiries into the two Warings&rsquo;
      affairs&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Gildersleeve crushed him with a sudden outburst of indignant
      wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cad!&rdquo; he cried, growing red in the face with horror and
      disgust. &ldquo;You dare to speak so to me, and to urge such motives! But
      you&rsquo;ve mistaken your man. I won&rsquo;t be bullied. If what you want
      is to use this vile knowledge you&rsquo;ve so vilely ferreted out, as a
      lever to compel me to marry my daughter to you against her will&mdash;I
      can only tell you, you sneak, you&rsquo;re on the wrong tack. I will never
      consent to it. You may do your worst, but you will never bend me. I&rsquo;m
      not a man to be bent or bullied&mdash;I won&rsquo;t be put down. I&rsquo;ll
      withstand you and defy you. You may ruin me, if you like, but you&rsquo;ll
      never break me. I stand here firm. Expose me, and I&rsquo;ll fight you to
      the bitter end: I&rsquo;ll fight you, and I&rsquo;ll conquer you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a fiery earnestness that Nevitt was only just beginning to
      understand. There was something in this. Here was a clue indeed to follow
      up and investigate. Surely, a menace to Granville Kelmscott&rsquo;s
      prospects could never have moved that heavy, phlegmatic, pachydermatous
      man to such an outburst of anger and suppressed fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expose YOU?&rdquo; Nevitt repeated, in a dazed and startled voice.
      &ldquo;Expose YOU, my dear sir! I assure you, in truth, I don&rsquo;t
      understand you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The barrister gazed down upon him with immeasurable scorn. &ldquo;You
      liar!&rdquo; he broke forth, almost choking at the words. &ldquo;How dare
      you so pretend and prevaricate to my face? I KNOW it&rsquo;s not true. My
      own daughter told me. She told me what you said to her&mdash;every word of
      your vile threats. You had the incredible meanness to terrify a poor
      helpless and innocent girl by threatening to expose her mother&rsquo;s
      disgrace publicly. Only YOU could have done it; but you did it, you abject
      thing, you did it. She told me with her own lips you threatened to come
      down to Mambury, to hunt up the records. And she told me the truth; for I&rsquo;ve
      seen you doing it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A light broke slowly upon Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s mind. He drew a deep
      breath. This was good luck incredible. What Gilbert Gildersleeve meant he
      hadn&rsquo;t as yet, to be sure, the faintest conception. But it was clear
      they two were at cross-questions with one another. The secret Gilbert
      Gildersleeve thought he had come down to Mambury to discover was not the
      secret he had actually found out in the register that morning. It was
      nothing about the Kelmscotts or Guy and Cyril Waring; it was something
      about the great Q..C. and his wife themselves&mdash;presumably some
      unknown and disgraceful fact in Mrs. Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s early
      history.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here was the cleverest lawyer at the English criminal bar just giving
      himself away&mdash;giving himself away unawares and telling him the
      secret, bit by bit, unconsciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chance was too valuable for Mr. Montague Nevitt to lose. At all risks
      he must worm it out. He paused and temporized. His cue was now not to let
      Gilbert Gildersleeve see he didn&rsquo;t know his secret. He must draw on
      the Q.C. by obscure half hints till he was inextricably entangled in a
      complete confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no intention of terrifying Miss Gildersleeve, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
      he said, in his blandest voice, with his best company smile, now
      recovering his equanimity exactly in proportion as the barrister grew
      angrier. &ldquo;I merely desired to satisfy myself as to the salient
      facts, and to learn their true bearing upon the family history. If I spoke
      to her at all as to any knowledge I might possess with regard to any other
      lady&rsquo;s early antecedents&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s brow was black as night. His great hands
      trembled and twitched convulsively. Was ever blackguard so cynically
      candid in his avowal of the basest crimes as this fine-spoken specimen of
      the culture of Pall Mall in his open confession of that disgusting insult
      to a young girl&rsquo;s innocence? Gilbert Gildersleeve, who was at heart
      an honest man, loathed and despised and scorned and detested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dare to hint to me, then,&rdquo; he cried, every muscle of
      his body quivering with just horror, &ldquo;that you told my own daughter
      you thought you had reason to suspect her own mother&rsquo;s early
      antecedents?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague Nevitt looked up at him with a quietly sarcastic smile. &ldquo;All&rsquo;s
      fair in love and war, you know,&rdquo; he said, not caring to commit
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      That smile sealed his fate. With an irrepressible impulse, Gilbert
      Gildersleeve sprang upon him. He didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt the man: he
      sprang upon him merely as the sole outlet for his own incensed and
      outraged feelings. Those great hands seized him for a second by the dainty
      white throat, and flung him back in anger. Montague Nevitt fell heavily on
      a thick mass of bracken. There was a gurgle, a gasp; then his head lolled
      senseless. He was very much hurt. That at least was certain. The barrister
      stood over him for a minute, still purple in the face. Montague Nevitt was
      white&mdash;very white and death-like. All at once it occurred to the big
      strong man that his hands&mdash;those great hands&mdash;were very fierce
      and powerful. He had clutched Nevitt by the throat, half unconsciously,
      with all his might, just to give him a purchase as he flung the man from
      him. He looked at him again. Great heavens&mdash;what was this? It burst
      over him at once. He awoke to it with a wild start. The fellow was dead!
      And this was clearly manslaughter!
    </p>
    <p>
      Justifiable homicide, if the jury knew all. But no jury now could ever
      know all. And he had killed him unawares! A great horror came over him.
      The man was dead&mdash;the man was dead; and he, Gilbert Gildersleeve, had
      unconsciously choked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no time to think. He had no time to calculate. His wrath was still
      hot, though rapidly cooling down before this awful discovery. Hide it!
      Hide it! Hide it! That was all he could think. He lifted the body in his
      arms, as easily as most men would lift a baby. Then he laid it down among
      the brambles close beside the stream. Something heavy fell out of the
      pocket as he carried it. The barrister took no heed. Little matter for
      that. He laid it down in fear and trembling. As soon as it was hidden, he
      fled for his life. By trackless ways, he walked over the Moor, and
      returned to Ivybridge unseen very late in the evening. Ten minutes after
      he left the spot, Guy Waring passed by and picked up the pocket-book.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV. &mdash; LEAD TRUMPS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Naturally, under these circumstances, it was all in vain that Guy Waring
      pursued his investigations into Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s whereabouts.
      Neither at Plymouth nor anywhere else along the skirts of Dartmoor could
      he learn that anything more had been seen or heard of the man who called
      himself &ldquo;Mr. McGregor.&rdquo; And yet Guy felt sure Nevitt wouldn&rsquo;t
      go far from Mambury, as things stood just then; for as soon as he missed
      the pocket-book containing the three thousand pounds, he would surely take
      some steps to recover it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later, however, Gilbert Gildersleeve sat in the hotel at
      Plymouth, where he had moved from Ivybridge after&mdash;well, as he
      phrased it to himself, after that unfortunate accident. The blustering
      Q.C. was like another man now. For the first time in his life he knew what
      it meant to be nervous and timid. Every sound made him suppress an
      involuntary start; for as yet he had heard no whisper of the body being
      discovered. He couldn&rsquo;t leave the neighbourhood, however, till the
      murder was out. Dangerous as he felt it to remain on the spot, some
      strange spell seemed to bind him against his will to Dartmoor. He must
      stop and hear what local gossip had to say when the body came to light.
      And above all, for the present, he hadn&rsquo;t the courage to go home; he
      dared not face his own wife and daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he stayed on and lounged, and pretended to interest himself with walks
      over the hills and up the Tamar valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat there in the billiard-room, that day, a young fellow entered
      whom he remembered to have seen once or twice in London, at evening
      parties, with Montague Nevitt. He turned pale at the sight&mdash;Gilbert
      Gildersleeve turned pale, that great red man. At first he didn&rsquo;t
      even remember the young fellow&rsquo;s name; but it came back to him in
      time that he was one Guy Waring. It was a hard ordeal to meet him, but
      Gilbert Gildersleeve felt he must brazen it out. To slink away from the
      young man would be to rouse suspicion. So they sat and talked for a minute
      or two together, on indifferent subjects, neither, to say truth, being
      very well pleased to see the other under such peculiar circumstances. Then
      Guy, who had the least reason for concealment of the two, sauntered out
      for a stroll, with his heart still full of that villain Nevitt, whose
      name, of course, he had never mentioned to Gilbert Gildersleeve. And
      Gilbert Gildersleeve, for his part, had had equal cause for a
      corresponding reticence as to their common acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Guy left the room, the landlord dropped in and began to talk with
      his guest about the latest new sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard the news, sir, this morning?&rdquo; he asked, with an
      important air. &ldquo;Inspector&rsquo;s just told me. A case very much in
      your line of business. Dead body&rsquo;s been discovered at Mambury,
      choked, and then thrown among the brake by the river. Name of McGregor&mdash;a
      visitor from London. And they do say the police have a clue to the
      murderer. Person who did it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s heart gave a great bound within him, and then
      stood stock-still; but by an iron effort of will he suppressed all outer
      sign of his profound emotion. He seemed to the observant eye merely
      interested and curious, as the landlord finished his sentence carelessly&mdash;&ldquo;Person
      who did it&rsquo;s supposed to be a young man who was at Mambury this
      week, of the name of Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s heart gave another bound, still more violent
      than before. But again he repressed with difficulty all external symptoms
      of his profound agitation. This was very strange news. Then somebody else
      was suspected instead of himself. In one way that was bad; for Gilbert
      Gildersleeve had a conscience and a sense of justice. But, in another way,
      why, it would save time for the moment, and divert attention from his own
      personality. Better anything now than immediate suspicion. In a week or
      two more every trace would be lost of his presence at Mambury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waring,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, turning over the name to
      himself, as if he attached it to no particular individual. &ldquo;Waring&mdash;Waring&mdash;Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused and looked hard. Ha! so far good! It was clear the landlord didn&rsquo;t
      know Waring was the name of the young man who had just left the
      billiard-room. This was lucky, indeed, for if he HAD known it now, and had
      taxed Guy then and there, before his own very face, with being the
      murderer of this unknown person at Mambury, Gilbert Gildersleeve felt no
      course would have been open for him save to tell the whole truth on the
      spot unreservedly. Try as he would, he COULDN&rsquo;T see another man
      arrested before his very eyes for the crime he himself had really, though
      almost unwittingly, committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waring,&rdquo; he repeated slowly, like one who endeavoured to
      collect his scattered thoughts; &ldquo;what sort of person was he, do you
      know? And how did the police come to get a clue to him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord, nothing loth, went off into a long and circumstantial story
      of the discovery of the body, with minute details of how the innkeeper at
      Mambury had traced the supposed murderer&mdash;who gave no name&mdash;by
      an envelope which he&rsquo;d left in his bedroom that evening. The county
      was up in arms about the affair to-day. All Dartmoor was being searched,
      and it was supposed the fellow was in hiding somewhere in the
      neighbourhood of Tavistock or Oakhampton. They&rsquo;d catch him by
      to-night. The landlord wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, indeed, now he came to
      think on it, if his truest himself&mdash;here a very long pause&mdash;were
      retained by-and-by for the prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Gildersleeve drew a deep breath, unperceived. That was all, was
      it? The pause had unnerved him. He talked some minutes, as unconcernedly
      as he could, though trembling inwardly all the while, about the murder and
      the murderer. The landlord listened with profound respect to the words of
      legal wisdom as they dropped from his lips; for he knew Mr. Gildersleeve
      by common repute as one of the ablest and acutest of criminal lawyers in
      all England. Then, after a short interval, the big burly man, moving his
      guilty fingers nervously over the seal on his watch-chain, and assuming as
      much as possible his ordinary air of blustering self-assertion, asked, in
      an off-hand fashion, &ldquo;By the way, let me see, I&rsquo;ve, some
      business to arrange; what&rsquo;s the number of my friend Mr. Billington&rsquo;s
      bedroom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord looked up with a little start of surprise. &ldquo;Mr.
      Billington?&rdquo; he said, hesitating. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got no Mr.
      Billington.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Gildersleeve smiled a sickly smile. It was neck or nothing now. He
      must go right through with it. &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he answered, with
      prompt conviction, playing a dangerous card well&mdash;for how could he
      know what name this young man Waring might possibly be passing under?
      &ldquo;The gentleman who was talking to me when you came in just now. His
      name&rsquo;s Billington&mdash;though, perhaps,&rdquo; he added, after a
      pause, with a reflective air, &ldquo;he may have given you another one.
      Young men will be young men. They&rsquo;ve often some reason, when
      travelling, for concealing their names. Though Billington&rsquo;s not the
      sort of fellow, to be sure, who&rsquo;s likely to be knocking about
      anywhere incognito.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord laughed. &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve plenty of that sort,&rdquo;
      he replied good-humouredly. &ldquo;Both ladies and gentlemen. It all makes
      trade. But your friend ain&rsquo;t one of &lsquo;em. To tell you the
      truth, he didn&rsquo;t give any name at all when he came to the hotel; and
      we didn&rsquo;t ask any. Billington, is it? Ah, Billington, Billington. I
      knew a Billington myself once, a trainer at Newmarket. Well, he&rsquo;s a
      very pleasant young man, nice-spoken, and that; but I don&rsquo;t fancy he&rsquo;s
      quite right in his head, somehow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With instinctive cleverness, Gilbert Gildersleeve snatched at the opening
      at once. &ldquo;Ah no, poor fellow,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head
      sympathetically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found that out already, have you?
      Well, he&rsquo;s subject to delusions a bit; mere harmless delusions; but
      he&rsquo;s not at all dangerous. Excitable, very, when anything odd turns
      up; he&rsquo;ll be calling himself Waring and giving himself in charge for
      this murder, I dare say, when he comes to hear of it. But as good-hearted
      a fellow as ever lived, though; only, a trifle obstinate. If you&rsquo;ve
      any difficulty with him at any time, just send for me. I&rsquo;ve known
      him from a boy. He&rsquo;ll do anything I tell him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a critical game, but Gilbert Gildersleeve saw something definite
      must be done, and he trusted to bluster, and a well-known name, to carry
      him through with it. And, indeed, he had said enough. From that moment
      forth, the landlord&rsquo;s suspicions were never even so much as aroused
      by the innocent young man with the preoccupied manner, who knew Mr.
      Gildersleeve. The great Q.C.&lsquo;s word was guarantee enough&mdash;for
      any one but himself. And the great Q.C. himself knew it. Why, a chance
      word from his lips was enough to protect Guy Waring from suspicion. Who
      would ever believe, then, anything so preposterously improbable as that
      the great Q.C. himself was the murderer?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not the police, you may be sure; nor the Plymouth landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out into the town, with his mind now filled full of a curious
      scheme. A plan of campaign loomed up visibly before him. Waring was
      suspected. Therefore Waring must somehow have given cause for suspicion.
      Well, Waring was a friend of Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s, and had evidently
      been at Mambury, either with him or without him, immediately before the&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;the
      unfortunate accident. But as soon as Waring came to learn of the discovery
      of the body, which he would be sure to do from the paper that evening at
      latest, he would see at once the full strength of whatever suspicions
      might tell against him. Now, Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s experience of
      criminal cases had abundantly shown him that a suspected person, even when
      innocent, always has one fixed desire in his head&mdash;to gain time,
      anyhow. So Waring would naturally wish to gain time, at whatever cost.
      There were evidently circumstances connecting Waring with the crime; there
      were none at all, known to the outer world, connecting the eminent lawyer.
      Therefore, the eminent lawyer argued to himself, as coolly almost as if it
      had been somebody else&rsquo;s case, not his own, he was conducting&mdash;therefore,
      if an immediate means of escape is provided for Waring, Waring will almost
      undoubtedly fall blindfold into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that he meant to let Guy pay the penalty in the end for his own rash
      crime. He was no hardened villain. He had still a conscience. If the worst
      came to the worst, he said to himself, he would tell all, openly, rather
      than let an innocent man suffer. But, like every one else, in accordance
      with his own inference from his observation of others, he, too, wanted to
      gain time, anyhow; and if he could but gain time by kindly helping Guy to
      escape for the present, why, he would gladly do so. An innocent man may be
      suspected for the moment, Gilbert Gildersleeve thought to himself, with a
      lawyer&rsquo;s blind confidence; but under our English law he need never
      at least fear that the suspicion will be permanent. For lawyers repeat
      their own incredible commonplaces about the absolute perfection of English
      law so often that at last, by a sort of retributive nemesis, they really
      almost come to believe them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filled with these ideas, then, which rose naturally up in his mind without
      his taking the trouble, as it were, definitely to prove them, Gilbert
      Gildersleeve hurried on through the crowded streets of Plymouth town, till
      he reached the office of the London and South African Steamship Company.
      There he entered with an air of decided business, and asked to take a
      passage to Cape Town at once by the steamer &ldquo;Cetewayo&rdquo;, due to
      call at Plymouth, outward bound, that evening. He had looked up
      particulars of sailing in the papers at the hotel, and asked now, as if
      for himself, for a large and roomy berth, with all his usual
      self-possession and boldness of manner. The clerk gazed at him carelessly;
      that big and burly man with the great awkward hands raised no picture in
      his brain of the supposed murderer of McGregor in the wood at Mambury as
      that murderer had been described to him by the police that morning, from a
      verbal portrait after the landlord of the Talbot Arms. This colossal,
      red-faced, loud-spoken person, who required a large and roomy berth, was
      certainly &ldquo;not&rdquo; the rather slim young man, a little above the
      medium height, with a dark moustache and a gentle musical voice, whom the
      inn-keeper had seen in an excited mood on the hunt for McGregor along the
      slopes of Dartmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name?&rdquo; the clerk asked briskly, after Gilbert
      Gildersleeve had selected his state-room from the plan, with some show of
      interest as to its being well amidships and not too near the noise of the
      engines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billington,&rdquo; the barrister answered, without a glimmer of
      hesitation. &ldquo;Arthur Standish Billington, if you want the full name.
      Thirty-two will suit me very well, I think, and I&rsquo;ll pay for it now.
      Go aboard when she&rsquo;s sighted, I suppose; nine o&rsquo;clock or
      thereabouts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk made out the ticket in the name he was told. &ldquo;Yes, nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;
      he said curtly. &ldquo;All luggage to be on board the tender by eight,
      sharp. You&rsquo;ve left taking your passage very late, Mr. Billington.
      Lucky we&rsquo;ve a room that&rsquo;ll suit you, I&rsquo;m sure, It isn&rsquo;t
      often we have berths left amidships like this on the day of sailing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Gildersleeve pretended to look unconcerned once more. &ldquo;No, I
      suppose not,&rdquo; he answered, in a careless voice. &ldquo;People
      generally know their own minds rather longer beforehand. But I&rsquo;d a
      telegram from the Cape this morning that calls me over immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He folded up his ticket, and put it in his pocket. Then he pulled out a
      roll of notes and paid the amount in full. The clerk gave him change
      promptly. Nobody could ever have suspected so solid a man as the great
      Q.C. of any more serious crime or misdemeanour than shirking the second
      service on Sunday evening. There was a ponderous respectability about his
      portly build that defied detection. The agents of all the steamboat
      companies had been warned that morning that the slim young man of the name
      of Waring might try to escape at the last moment. But who could ever
      suspect this colossal pile, in the British churchwarden style of human
      architecture, of aiding and abetting the escape of the young man Waring
      from the pervasive myrmidons of English justice? The very idea was absurd.
      Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s waistcoat was above suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Guy Waring returned to his room at the Duke of Devonshire Hotel
      half an hour later, in complete ignorance as yet of the bare fact of the
      murder, he found on his table an envelope addressed, in an unknown hand,
      &ldquo;Guy Waring, Esq.,&rdquo; while below in the corner, twice
      underlined, were the importunate words, &ldquo;IMMEDIATE! IMPORTANT!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy tore it open in wonder. What on earth could this mean? He trembled as
      he read. Could Cyril have learnt all? Or had Nevitt, that double-dyed
      traitor, now trebled his treachery by informing against the man whom he
      had driven into a crime? Guy couldn&rsquo;t imagine what it all could be
      driving at, for there, before his eyes, in a round schoolboy hand, very
      carefully formed, without the faintest trace of anything like character,
      were the words of this strange and startling message, whose origin and
      intent were alike a mystery to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guy Waring, a warrant is out for your apprehension. Fly at once, or
      things may be worse for you. It is something always to gain time for the
      moment. You will avoid suspicion, public scandal, trial. Enclosed find a
      ticket for Cape Town by the Cetewayo to-night. She sails at nine. Luggage
      to be on board the tender by eight sharp. If you go, all can yet be
      satisfactorily cleared up. If you stay, the danger is great, and may be
      very serious. Ticket is taken (and paid for) in the name of Arthur
      Standish Billington. Settle your account at the hotel in that name and go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, in frantic haste,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;A SINCERE WELL-WISHER.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      Guy gazed at the strange missive long and dubiously. &ldquo;A warrant is
      out.&rdquo; He scarcely knew what to do. Oh, for time, time, time! Had
      Cyril sent this? Or was it some final device of that fiend, Nevitt?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. &mdash; A CHANCE MEETING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There wasn&rsquo;t much time left, however, for Guy to make up his mind
      in. He must decide at once. Should he accept this mysterious warning or
      not? Pure fate decided it. As he hesitated he heard a boy crying in the
      street. It was the special-edition-fiend calling his evening paper. The
      words the boy said Guy didn&rsquo;t altogether catch; but the last
      sentence of all fell on his ear distinctly. He started in horror. It was
      an awful sound: &ldquo;Warrant issued to-day for the apprehension of
      Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the letter, whoever wrote it, was not all a lie. The forgery was out.
      Cyril or the bankers had learnt the whole truth. He was to be arrested
      to-day as a common felon. All the world knew his shame. He hid his face in
      his hands. Come what might, he must accept the mysterious warning now. He
      would take the ticket, and go off to South Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment a whole policy had arisen like a cloud and framed itself in
      his mind. He was a forger, he knew, and by this time Cyril too most
      probably knew it. But he had the three thousand pounds safe and sound in
      his pocket, and those at least he could send back to Cyril. With them he
      could send a cheque on his own banker for three thousand more; not that
      there were funds there at present to meet the demand; but if the unknown
      benefactor should pay in the six thousand he promised within the next few
      weeks, then Cyril could repay himself from that hypothetical fortune. On
      the other hand, Guy didn&rsquo;t disguise from himself the strong
      probability that the unknown benefactor might now refuse to pay in the six
      thousand. In that case, Guy said to himself with a groan, he would take to
      the diamond fields, and never rest day or night in his self-imposed task
      till he had made enough to repay Cyril in full the missing three thousand,
      and to make up the other three thousand he still owed the creditors of the
      Rio Negro Company. After which, he would return and give himself up like a
      man, to stand his trial voluntarily for the crime he had committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a young man&rsquo;s scheme, very fond and youthful; but with the
      full confidence of his age he proceeded at once to put it in practice.
      Indeed, now he came to think upon it, he fancied to himself he saw
      something like a solution of the mystery in the presence of the great Q.C.
      at Plymouth that morning. Cyril had found out all, and had determined to
      save him. The bankers had found out all, and had determined to prosecute.
      They had consulted Gildersleeve. Gildersleeve had come down on a holiday
      trip, and run up against him at Plymouth by pure accident. Indeed, Guy
      remembered now that the great Q.C. looked not a little surprised and
      excited at meeting him. Clearly Gildersleeve had communicated with the
      police at once; hence the issue of the warrant. At the same time the
      writer of the letter, whoever he might be&mdash;and Guy now believed he
      was sent down by Cyril, or in Cyril&rsquo;s interest&mdash;the writer had
      found out the facts betimes, and had taken a passage for him in the name
      of Billington. Uncertain as he felt about the minor details, Guy was sure
      this interpretation must be right in the main. For Elma&rsquo;s sake&mdash;for
      the honour of the family&mdash;Cyril wished him for the present to
      disappear. Cyril&rsquo;s wish was sacred. He would go to South Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great point was now to avoid meeting Gildersleeve before the ship
      sailed. So he would pay his bill quietly, put his things in his
      portmanteau, stop in his room till dusk, and then drive off in a close cab
      to the landing-stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, first of all, he must send the three thousand direct to Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in a fit of profound penitence, and penned a heart-broken
      letter of confession to his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was vague, of course; such letters are always vague; no man, even in
      confessing, likes to allude in plain terms to the exact nature of the
      crime he has committed; and besides, Guy took it for granted that Cyril
      knew all about the main features of the case already. He didn&rsquo;t ask
      his brother to forgive him, he said; he didn&rsquo;t try to explain, for
      explanation would be impossible. How he came to do it, he had no idea
      himself. A sudden suggestion&mdash;a strange unaccountable impulse&mdash;a
      minute or two of indecision&mdash;and almost before he knew it, under the
      spell of that strange eye, the thing was done, irretrievably done for
      ever. The best he could offer now was to express his profound and undying
      regret at the wrong he had committed, and by which he had never profited
      himself a single farthing. Nevitt had deceived him with incredible
      meanness; he could never have believed any man would act as Nevitt had
      acted. Nevitt had stolen three thousand pounds of the sum, and applied
      them to paying off his own debt to the Rio Negro creditors: The remaining
      three thousand, sent herewith, Guy had recovered, almost by a miracle,
      from that false creature&rsquo;s grasp, and he returned them now, in proof
      of the fact, in Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s own pocket-book, which Cyril would
      no doubt immediately recognise. For himself, he meant to leave England at
      once, at least for the present. Where he was going he wouldn&rsquo;t as
      yet let Cyril know. He hoped in a new country to recover his honour and
      rehabilitate his name. Meanwhile, it was mainly for Cyril&rsquo;s sake
      that he fled&mdash;and for one other person&rsquo;s too&mdash;to avoid a
      scandal. He hoped Cyril would be happy with the woman of his choice; for
      it was to insure their joint happiness that he was accepting the offer of
      escape so unexpectedly tendered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sealed up the letter&mdash;that incriminating letter, that might mean
      so much more than he ever put into it&mdash;and took it out to the post,
      with the three thousand pounds and Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s pocket-book in
      a separate packet. Proud Kelmscott as he was by birth and nature, he slunk
      through the streets like a guilty man, fancying all eyes were fixed
      suspiciously upon him. Then he returned to the hotel in a burning heat,
      went into the smoking room on purpose like an honest man, and rang the
      bell for the servant boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring my bill, please,&rdquo; he said to the waiter who answered
      it. &ldquo;I go at seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the waiter replied, with official promptitude.
      &ldquo;Directly, sir. What number?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget the number,&rdquo; Guy answered, with a beating heart;
      &ldquo;but the name&rsquo;s Billington.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the waiter responded once more, in the self-same
      unvaried tone, and went off to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy waited in profound suspense, half expecting the waiter to come back
      for the number again; but to his immense surprise and mystification, the
      fellow didn&rsquo;t. Instead of that, he returned some minutes later, all
      respectful attention, bringing the bill on a salver, duly headed and
      lettered, &ldquo;Mr. Billington, number 40.&rdquo; In unspeakable
      trepidation, Guy paid it and walked away. Never before in all his life had
      he been surrounded so close on every side by a thick hedge of impenetrable
      and inexplicable mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a new terror seized him. Was he running his head into a noose,
      blindfold? Who was the Billington he was thus made to personate, and who
      must really be staying at the very same time in the Duke of Devonshire?
      Was this just another of Nevitt&rsquo;s wily tricks? Had he induced his
      victim to accept without question the name and character of some still
      more open criminal?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time now, however, to drawback or to hesitate. The die was
      cast; he must stand by its arbitrament. He had decided to go, and on that
      hasty decision had acted in a way that was practically irrevocable. He put
      his things together with trembling hands, called a cab by the porter, and
      drove off alone in a turmoil of doubt, to the landing-stage in the
      harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Policemen not a few were standing about on the pier and in the streets as
      he drove past openly. But in spite of the fact that a warrant had been
      issued for his apprehension, none of them took the slightest apparent
      notice of him. He wondered much at this. But there was really no just
      cause for wonder. For at least an hour earlier the police had ceased to
      look out any longer for Nevitt&rsquo;s murderer. And the reason they had
      done so was simply this: a telegram had come down from Scotland Yard in
      the most positive terms, &ldquo;Waring arrested this afternoon at Dover.
      The murdered man McGregor is now certainly known to be Montague Nevitt, a
      bank clerk in London. Endeavour to trace Waring&rsquo;s line of retreat
      from Mambury to Dover by inquiry of the railway officials. We are sure of
      our man. Photographs will be forwarded you by post immediately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as a matter of fact, at the very moment when Guy was driving down to
      the tender, in order to escape from an imaginary charge of forgery, his
      brother Cyril, to his own immense astonishment, was being conveyed from
      Dover Pier to Tavistock, under close police escort, on a warrant charging
      him with the wilful murder of Montague Nevitt, two days before, at
      Mambury, in Devon.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Guy had only known that, he would never have fled. But he didn&rsquo;t
      know it. How could he, indeed, in his turmoil and hurry? He didn&rsquo;t
      even know Montague Nevitt was dead. He had been too busy that day to look
      at the papers. And the few facts he knew from the boys crying in the
      street he naturally misinterpreted, by the light of his own fears and
      personal dangers. He thought he was &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; for the yet
      undiscovered forgery, not for the murder, of which he was wholly ignorant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, we can never in this world entirely escape our own
      personality. As Guy went on board, believing himself to have left his
      identity on shore, he heard somebody, in a voice that he fancied he knew,
      ask a newsboy on the tender for an evening paper. Guy was the only
      passenger who embarked at Plymouth; and this person unseen was the newsboy&rsquo;s
      one customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy couldn&rsquo;t discover who he was at the moment, for the call for a
      paper came from the upper deck; he only heard the voice, and wasn&rsquo;t
      certain at first that he recognised even that any more than in a vague and
      indeterminate reminiscence. No doubt the sense of guilt made him
      preternaturally suspicious. But he began to fear that somebody might
      possibly recognise him. And he had bought the paper with news about the
      warrant. That was bad; but &lsquo;twas too late to draw back again now.
      The tender lay alongside a while, discharging her mails, and then cast
      loose to go. The Cetewayo&rsquo;s screw began to move through the water.
      With a dim sense of horror, Guy knew they were off. He was well under way
      for far distant South Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did NOT know or reflect that while he ploughed his path on over
      that trackless sea, day after day, without news from England, there would
      be ample time for Cyril to be tried, and found guilty, and perhaps hanged
      as well, for the crime that neither of them had really committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great ship steamed out, cutting the waves with her prow, and left the
      harbour lights far, far behind her. Guy stood on deck and watched them
      disappearing with very mingled feelings. Everything had been so hurried,
      he hardly knew himself as yet how his flight affected all the active and
      passive characters in this painful drama. He only knew he was irrevocably
      committed to the voyage now. There would be no chance of turning till they
      reached Cape Town, or at, the very least Madeira.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood on deck and looked back. Somebody else in an ulster stood not far
      off, near a light by the saloon, conversing with an officer. Guy
      recognised at once the voice of the man who had asked in the harbour for
      an evening paper. At that moment a steward came up as he stood there, on
      the look-out for the new passenger they&rsquo;d just taken in. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      in thirty-two, sir, I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and your name&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Billington,&rdquo; Guy answered, with a faint tremor of shame at
      the continued falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who had bought the paper turned round sharply and stared at him.
      Their eyes met in one quick flash of unexpected recognition. Guy started
      in horror. This was an awful meeting. He had seen the man but once before
      in his life, yet he knew him at a glance. It was Granville Kelmscott.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or two they stood and stared at one another blankly, those
      unacknowledged half-brothers, of whom one now knew, while the other still
      ignored, the real relationship that existed between them. Then Granville
      Kelmscott turned away without one word of greeting. Guy trembled in his
      shame. He knew he was discovered. But before his very eyes, Granville took
      the paper he had been reading by that uncertain light, and, raising it
      high in his hand, flung it over into the sea with spasmodic energy. It was
      the special edition containing the account of the man McGregor&rsquo;s
      death and Guy Waring&rsquo;s supposed connection with the murder.
      Granville Kelmscott, indeed, couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to denounce his
      own half-brother. He stared at him coldly for a second with a horrified
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said, in a very low and distant voice, &ldquo;I know your
      identity, Mr. Billington,&rdquo; with a profoundly sarcastic accent on the
      assumed name, &ldquo;and I will not betray it. I know your secret, too;
      and I will keep that inviolate. Only, during the rest of this voyage, do
      me the honour, I beg of you, not to recognise me or speak to me in any way
      at any time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy slunk away in silence to his own cabin. Never before in his life had
      he known such shame. He felt that his punishment was indeed too heavy for
      him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. &mdash; SOMETHING TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At Tilgate and Chetwood next morning, two distinguished households were
      thrown into confusion by the news in the papers. To Colonel Kelmscott and
      to Elma Clifford alike that news came with crushing force and horror. A
      murder, said the Times, had been committed in Devonshire, in a romantic
      dell, on the skirts of Dartmoor. No element of dramatic interest was
      wanting to the case; persons, place, and time were all equally remarkable.
      The victim of the outrage was Mr. Montague Nevitt, confidential clerk to
      Messrs. Drummond, Coutts, and Barclay, the well-known bankers, and himself
      a familiar figure in musical society in London. The murderer was
      presumably a young journalist, Mr. Guy Waring, not unknown himself in
      musical circles, and brother of that rising landscape painter, Mr. Cyril
      Waring, whose pictures of wild life in forest scenery had lately attracted
      considerable attention at the Academy and the Grosvenor. Mr. Guy Waring
      had been arrested the day before on the pier at Dover, where he had just
      arrived by the Ostend packet. It was supposed by the police that he had
      hastily crossed the Channel from Plymouth to Cherbourg, soon after the
      murder, to escape detection, and, after journeying by cross-country routes
      through France and Belgium, had returned via Ostend to the shores of
      England. It was a triumphant vindication of our much maligned detective
      system that within a few hours after the discovery of the body on
      Dartmoor, the supposed criminal should have been recognised, arrested, and
      detained among a thousand others, in a busy port, at the very opposite
      extremity of southern England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Kelmscott that day was strangely touched, even before he took up
      his morning paper. A letter from Granville, posted at Plymouth, had just
      reached him by the early mail, to tell him that the only son he had ever
      really loved or cared for on earth had sailed the day before, a
      disinherited outcast, to seek his fortune in the wild wastes of Africa.
      How he could break the news to Lady Emily he couldn&rsquo;t imagine. The
      Colonel, twisting his white moustache, with a quivering hand on his
      tremulous lip, hardly dared to realize what their future would seem like.
      And then&mdash;he turned to the paper, and saw to his horror this awful
      tale of a cold-blooded and cowardly murder, committed on a friend by one
      who, however little he might choose to acknowledge it, was after all his
      own eldest son, a Kelmscott of Tilgate, as much as Granville himself, in
      lawful wedlock duly begotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proud but broken man gazed at the deadly announcement in blank amaze
      and agony. His Nemesis had come. Guy Waring was his own son&mdash;and Guy
      Waring was a murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to argue with himself at first that this tragic result in some
      strange way justified him, after the event, for his own long neglect of
      his parental responsibilities. The young man was no true Kelmscott at
      heart, he was sure, or such an act as that would have revolted and
      appalled him. He was no true son in reality; his order disowned him. Base
      blood flowed in his veins, and made crimes like these conceivable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was right after all,&rdquo; the Colonel thought, &ldquo;not to
      acknowledge these half low-born lads as the heirs of Tilgate. Bad blood
      will out in the end&mdash;and THIS is the result of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, with sudden revulsion he thought once more&mdash;God help him!
      How could he say such things in his heart even now of HER, his pure,
      trustful Lucy? She was better than him in her soul, he knew&mdash;ten
      thousand times better. If bad blood came in anywhere, it came in from
      himself, not from that simple-hearted, innocent little country-bred angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And perhaps if he&rsquo;d treated these lads as he ought, and brought them
      up to their own, and made them Kelmscotts indeed, instead of nameless
      adventurers, they might never have fallen into such abysses of turpitude.
      But he had let them grow up in ignorance of their own origin, with the
      vague stain of a possible illegitimacy hanging over their heads; and what
      wonder if they forgot in the end how noblesse oblige, and sank at last
      into foul depths of vice and criminality?
    </p>
    <p>
      As he read on, his head swam with the cumulative evidence of that
      deliberately planned and cruelly executed yet brutal murder. The details
      of the crime gave him a sickening sense of loathing and incredulity.
      Impossible that his own son could have schemed and carried out so vile an
      attack upon a helpless person, who had once been his nearest and dearest
      companion. And yet, the account in the paper gave him no alternative but
      to believe it. Nevitt and Guy Waring had been inseparable friends. They
      had dined together, supped together, played duets in their own rooms, gone
      out to the same parties, belonged to the same club, in all things been
      closer than even the two twin brothers. Some quarrel seemed to have arisen
      about a matter of speculations in which both had suffered. They separated
      at once&mdash;separated in anger. Nevitt went down to Devonshire by
      himself for his holiday. Then Waring followed him, without any pretence at
      concealment; inquired for him at the village inn with expressions of
      deadly hate; tracked him to a lonely place in the adjacent wood; choked
      him, apparently with some form of garotte or twisted rope&mdash;for the
      injuries seemed greater than even the most powerful man could possibly
      inflict with the hands alone; and hid the body of his murdered friend at
      last in a mossy dell by the bank of the streamlet. Nor was that all; for
      with callous effrontery he had returned to the inn, still inquiring after
      his victim; and had gone off next morning early with a lie on his lips,
      pretending even then to nurse his undying wrath and to be bent on
      following up with coarse threats of revenge his stark and silent enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far the Times. But to Colonel Kelmscott, reading in between the lines
      as he went, there was more in it than even that. He saw, though dimly,
      some hint of a motive. For it was at Mambury that all these things had
      taken place; and it was at Mambury that the secret of Guy Waring&rsquo;s
      descent lay buried, as he thought, in the parish registers. What it all
      meant, Colonel Kelmscott couldn&rsquo;t indeed wholly understand; but many
      things he knew which the writer of the account in the Times knew not. He
      knew that Nevitt was a clerk in the bank where he himself kept his
      account, and to which he had given orders to pay in the six thousand to
      Cyril&rsquo;s credit, at Cyril&rsquo;s bankers. He knew, therefore, that
      Nevitt might thus have been led to suspect the real truth of the case as
      to the two so-called Warings. He knew that Cyril had just received the six
      thousand. Trying to put these facts together and understand their meaning
      he utterly failed; but this much at least was clear to him, he thought&mdash;the
      reason for the murder was something connected with a search for the entry
      of his own clandestine marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at the paper again. Great heavens, what was this? &ldquo;It
      is rumoured that a further inducement to the crime may perhaps be sought
      in the fact that the deceased gentleman had a large sum of money in his
      possession in Bank of England notes at the time of his death. These notes
      he carried in a pocket-book about his person, where they were seen by the
      landlord of the Talbot Arms at Mambury, the night before the supposed
      murder. When the body was discovered by the side of the brook, two days
      later, the notes were gone. The pockets were carefully searched by order
      of the police, but no trace of the missing money could be discovered. It
      is now conjectured that Mr. Guy Waring, who is known to have lost heavily
      in the Rio Negro Diamond Mines, may have committed the crime from purely
      pecuniary motives, in order to release himself from his considerable and
      very pressing financial embarrassments.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper dropped from Colonel Kelmscott&rsquo;s hands. His eyes ceased to
      see. His arm fell rigid. This last horrible suggestion proved too much for
      him to bear. He shrank from it like poison. That a son of his own,
      unacknowledged or not, should be a criminal&mdash;a murderer&mdash;was
      terrible enough; but that he should even be suspected of having committed
      murder for such base and vulgar motives as mere thirst of gain was more
      than the blood of the Kelmscotts could put up with. The unhappy father had
      said to himself in his agony at first that if Guy really killed that
      prying bank clerk at all, it was no doubt in defence of his mother&rsquo;s
      honour. THAT was a reason a Kelmscott could understand. That, if not an
      excuse, was at least a palliation. But to be told he had killed him for a
      roll of bank-notes&mdash;oh, horrible, incredible; his reason drew back at
      it. That was a depth to which the Kelmscott idiosyncrasy could never
      descend. The Colonel in his horror refused to believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hands up feebly to his throbbing brow. This was a ghastly idea&mdash;a
      ghastly accusation. The man called Waring had dragged the honour of the
      Kelmscotts through the mud of the street. There was but one comfort left.
      He never bore that unsullied name. Nobody would know he was a Kelmscott of
      Tilgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel rose from his seat, and staggered across the floor. Half-way
      to the door, he reeled and stopped short. The veins of his forehead were
      black and swollen. He had the same strange feeling in his head as he
      experienced on the day when Granville left&mdash;only a hundred times
      worse. The two halves of his brain were opening and shutting. His temples
      seemed too full; he fancied there was something wrong with his forehead
      somewhere. He reeled once more, like a drunken man. Then he clutched at a
      chair and sat down. His brain was flooded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He collapsed all at once, mumbling to himself some inarticulate gibberish.
      Half an hour later, the servants came in and found him. He was seated in
      his chair, still doddering feebly. The house was roused. A doctor was
      summoned, and the Colonel put to bed. Lady Emily watched him with devoted
      care. But it was all in vain. The doctor shook his head the moment he
      examined him. &ldquo;A paralytic stroke,&rdquo; he said gravely; &ldquo;and
      a very serious one. He seems to have had a slighter attack some time
      since, and to have wholly neglected it. A great blood-vessel in the brain
      must have given way with a rush. I can hold out no hope. He won&rsquo;t
      live till morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, as it turned out, about ten that night the Colonel&rsquo;s
      loud and stentorious breathing began to fail slowly. The intervals grew
      longer and longer between each recurrent gasp, and life died away at last
      in imperceptible struggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      By two in the morning, Kelmscott of Tilgate lay dead on his bed; and his
      two unacknowledged and unrecognised sons were the masters of his property.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one of them was at that moment being tossed about wildly on the waves
      of Biscay; and the other was locked up on a charge of murder in the county
      jail at Tavistock, in Devonshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, at the other house at Chetwood, where these tidings were being
      read with almost equal interest, Elma Clifford laid down the paper on the
      table with a very pale face, and looked at her mother. Mrs. Clifford, all
      solicitous watchfulness for the effect on Elma, looked in return with
      searching eyes at her daughter. Then Elma opened her lips like one who
      talks in her sleep, and spoke out twice in two short disconnected
      sentences. The first time she said simply, &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do it, I
      know,&rdquo; and the second time, with all the intensity of her emotional
      nature, &ldquo;Mother, mother, whatever turns up, I MUST go there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HE will be there,&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford interposed, after a painful
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Elma answered dreamily, with her great eyes far away, &ldquo;Yes, of
      course, I know he will. And I must be there too, to see how far, if at
      all, I can help them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darling,&rdquo; her mother replied, stroking her daughter&rsquo;s
      hair with a caressing hand. She knew that when Elma spoke in a tone like
      that, no power on earth could possibly restrain her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII. &mdash; MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      To Cyril Waring himself, the arrest at Dover came as an immense surprise;
      rather a surprise, indeed, than a shock just at first, for he could only
      treat it as a mistaken identity. The man the police wanted was Guy, not
      himself; and that Guy should have done it was clearly incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he landed from the Ostend packet, recalled to England unexpectedly by
      the announcement that the Rio Negro Diamond Mines had gone with a crash&mdash;and
      no doubt involved Guy in the common ruin&mdash;Cyril was astonished to
      find himself greeted on the Admiralty Pier by a policeman, who tapped him
      on the shoulder with the casual remark, &ldquo;I think your name&rsquo;s
      Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril answered at once, &ldquo;Yes, my name&rsquo;s Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn&rsquo;t occur to him at the moment that the man meant to arrest
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re wanted,&rdquo; the minion of authority answered,
      seizing his arm rather gruffly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a warrant out
      to-day against you, my friend. You&rsquo;d better come along with me
      quietly to the station.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A warrant!&rdquo; Cyril repeated, amazed, shaking off the man&rsquo;s
      hand. &ldquo;There must be some mistake somewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman smiled. &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he answered briskly, with some
      humour in his tone. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a mistake, of course, in
      all these arrests. You never get a hold of the right man just at first. It&rsquo;s
      sure to be a case of his twin brother. But there ain&rsquo;t no mistake
      this time, don&rsquo;t you fear. I knowed you at once, when I see you, by
      your photograph. Though we were looking out for you, to be sure, going the
      other way. But it&rsquo;s you all right. There ain&rsquo;t a doubt about
      that. Warrant in the name of Guy Waring, gentleman; wanted for the wilful
      murder of a man unknown, said to be one McGregor, alias Montague Nevitt,
      on the 27th instant, at Mambury, in Devonshire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril gave a sudden start at the conjunction of names, which naturally
      increased his captor&rsquo;s suspicions. &ldquo;But there IS a mistake,
      though,&rdquo; he said angrily, &ldquo;even on your own showing. You&rsquo;ve
      got the wrong man. It&rsquo;s not I that am wanted. My name&rsquo;s Cyril
      Waring, and Guy is my brother&rsquo;s. Though Guy can&rsquo;t have
      murdered Mr. Nevitt, either, if it comes to that; they were most intimate
      friends. However, that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. I&rsquo;m Cyril,
      not Guy; I&rsquo;m not your prisoner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, you are, though,&rdquo; the officer answered, holding his
      arm very tight, and calling mutely for assistance by a glance at the other
      policemen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got your photograph in my pocket right
      enough. Here&rsquo;s the man we&rsquo;ve orders to arrest at once. I
      suppose you won&rsquo;t deny, now, that&rsquo;s your living image.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril glanced at the photograph with another start of surprise. Sure
      enough, it WAS Guy; his last new cabinet portrait. The police must be
      acting under some gross misapprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man&rsquo;s my brother,&rdquo; he said confidently, brushing
      the photograph aside. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it at all. This is
      extremely odd. It&rsquo;s impossible my brother can even be suspected of
      committing murder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman smiled cynically. &ldquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t impossible
      your brother&rsquo;s brother can be suspected, anyhow,&rdquo; he said,
      with a quiet air of superior knowledge. &ldquo;The good old double trick&rsquo;s
      been tried on once too often. If I was you, I wouldn&rsquo;t say too much.
      Whatever you say may be used as evidence at the trial against you. You
      just come along quietly to the station with me&mdash;take his other arm,
      Jim, that&rsquo;s right: no violence please, prisoner&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll
      pretty soon find out whether you&rsquo;re the man we&rsquo;ve got orders
      to arrest, or his twin brother.&rdquo; And he winked at his ally. He was
      proud of having effected the catch of the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I AM his twin brother,&rdquo; Cyril said, half struggling still
      to release himself. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take me up on that warrant, I
      tell you. It&rsquo;s not my name. I&rsquo;m not the man you&rsquo;ve
      orders to look for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; the constable answered as
      before, with an incredulous smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go trying to
      obstruct the police in the exercise of their duty. If I can&rsquo;t take
      you up on the warrant as it stands, well, anyhow, I can arrest you on
      suspicion all the same, for looking so precious like the photograph of the
      man as is wanted. Twin brothers ain&rsquo;t got any call, don&rsquo;t you
      know, to sit, turn about, for one another&rsquo;s photographs. It hinders
      the administration of justice; that&rsquo;s where it is. And remember,
      whatever you choose to say may be used as evidence at the trial against
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus adjured, Cyril yielded at last to force majeure and walked arm in arm
      between the two policemen, followed by a large and admiring crowd, to the
      nearest station.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the matter was far less easily arranged than at first imagined. An
      innocent man who knows his own innocence, taken up in mistake for a
      brother whom he believes to be equally incapable of the crime with which
      he is charged, naturally expects to find no difficulty at all in proving
      his identity and escaping from custody on a false charge of murder. But
      the result of a hasty examination at the station soon effectually removed
      this little delusion. His own admission that the photograph was a portrait
      of Guy, and his resemblance to it in every leading particular, made the
      authorities decide on the first blush of the thing this was really the man
      Scotland Yard was in search of. He was trying to escape them on the
      ridiculous pretext that he was in point of fact his own twin brother. The
      inspector declined to let him go for the night. He wasn&rsquo;t going to
      repeat the mistake that was made in the Lefroy case, he said very
      decidedly. He would send the suspected person under escort to Tavistock.
    </p>
    <p>
      So to Tavistock Cyril went, uncertain as yet what all this could mean, and
      ignorant of the crime with which he was charged, if indeed any crime had
      been really committed. All the way down, an endless string of questions
      suggested themselves one by one to his excited mind. Was Nevitt really
      dead? And if so, who had killed him? Was it suicide to escape from the
      monetary embarrassments brought about by the failure of the Rio Negro
      Diamond Mines, or was it accident or mischance? Or was it in fact a
      murder? And in any case&mdash;strangest of all&mdash;where was Guy? Why
      didn&rsquo;t Guy come forward and court inquiry? For as yet, of course,
      Cyril hadn&rsquo;t received his brother&rsquo;s letter, with the
      incriminating pocket-book and the three thousand pounds; nor indeed, for
      several days after, as things turned out, was there even a possibility of
      his ever receiving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, however, when Cyril was examined before the Tavistock
      magistrates, he began to realize the whole strength of the case against
      him. The proceedings were purely formal, as the lawyers said; yet they
      were quite enough to make Cyril&rsquo;s cheek turn pale with horror. One
      witness after another came forward and swore to him. The station-master at
      Mambury gave evidence that he had made inquiries on the platform after
      Nevitt by name; the inn-keeper deposed as to his excited behaviour when he
      called at the Talbot Arms, and his recognition of McGregor as the person
      he was in search of; the boy of whom Guy had inquired at the gate
      unhesitatingly set down the conversation to Cyril. None of them had the
      faintest doubt in his own mind&mdash;each swore&mdash;that the prisoner
      before the magistrates was the self-same person who went over to Mambury
      on that fatal day, and who followed Montague Nevitt down the path by the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Cyril listened, one terrible fact dawned clearer and clearer upon his
      brain. Every fragment of evidence they piled up against himself made the
      case against Guy look blacker and blacker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrates accepted the proofs thus tendered, and Cyril, as yet
      unassisted by professional advice, was remanded accordingly till next
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was about to leave the Sessions House in a tumult of horror,
      fear, and suspense, somebody close by tapped him on the shoulder gravely,
      after a few whispered words with the chairman and the magistrates. Cyril
      turned round, and saw a burly man with very large hands, whom he
      remembered to have had pointed out to him in London, and, strange to say,
      by Montague Nevitt himself&mdash;as the eminent Q.C., Mr. Gilbert
      Gildersleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great advocate was pale, but very sincere and earnest. Cyril noticed
      his manner was completely changed. It was clear some overmastering idea
      possessed his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Waring,&rdquo; he said, looking him full in the face, &ldquo;I
      see you&rsquo;re unrepresented. This is a case in which I take a very deep
      interest. My conduct&rsquo;s unprofessional, I know&mdash;point-blank
      against all our recognised etiquette&mdash;but perhaps you&rsquo;ll excuse
      it. Will you allow me to undertake your defence in this matter?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril turned round to him with truly heartfelt thanks. It was a great
      relief to him, alone and in doubt, and much wondering about Guy, to hear a
      friendly word from whatever quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Cyril knew he was safe in Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s hands: the
      greatest criminal lawyer of the day in England might surely be trusted to
      set right such a mere little error of mistaken identity. Though for Guy&mdash;whenever
      Guy gave himself up to the police&mdash;Cyril felt the position was far
      more dangerous. He couldn&rsquo;t believe, indeed, that Guy was guilty;
      yet the circumstances, he could no longer conceal from himself, looked
      terribly black against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too good,&rdquo; he cried, taking the lawyer&rsquo;s
      hand in his with very fervent gratitude. &ldquo;How can I thank you
      enough? I&rsquo;m deeply obliged to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Gilbert Gildersleeve answered, with very
      blanched lips. He was ashamed of his duplicity. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      nothing to thank me for. This case is a simple one, and I&rsquo;d like to
      see you out of it. I&rsquo;ve met your brother; and the moment I saw you I
      knew you weren&rsquo;t he, though you&rsquo;re very like him. I should
      know you two apart wherever I saw you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s curious,&rdquo; Cyril cried, &ldquo;for very few
      people know us from one another, except the most intimate friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Q.C. looked at him with a very penetrating glance. &ldquo;I had
      occasion to see your brother not long since,&rdquo; he answered slowly,
      &ldquo;and his features and expression fastened themselves indelibly on my
      mind&rsquo;s eye. I should know you from him at a glance. This case, as
      you say, is one of mistaken identity. That&rsquo;s just why I&rsquo;m so
      anxious to help you well through it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, Gilbert Gildersleeve, profoundly agitated as he was, saw in
      the accident a marvellous chance for himself to secure a diversion of
      police attention from the real murderer. The fact was, he had passed
      twenty-four hours of supreme misery. As soon as he learned from common
      report that &ldquo;the murderer was caught, and was being brought to
      Tavistock,&rdquo; he took it for granted at first that Guy hadn&rsquo;t
      gone to Africa at all, but had left by rail for the East, and been
      arrested elsewhere. That belief filled him full of excruciating terrors.
      For Gilbert Gildersleeve, accidental manslaughterer as he was, was not by
      any means a depraved or wholly heartless person. Big, blustering, and
      gruff, he was yet in essence an honest, kind-hearted, unemotional
      Englishman. His one desire now was to save his wife and daughter from
      further misery; and if he could only save them, he was ready to sacrifice
      for the moment, to a certain extent, Guy Waring&rsquo;s reputation. But if
      Guy Waring himself had stood before him in the dock, he must have stepped
      forward to confess. The strain would have been too great for him. He
      couldn&rsquo;t have allowed an innocent man to be hanged in his place.
      Come what might, in that case he must let his wife and daughter go, and
      save the innocent by acknowledging himself guilty. So, when he looked at
      the prisoner, it gave him a shock of joy to see that fortune had once more
      befriended him. Thank Heaven, thank Heaven, it wasn&rsquo;t the man they
      wanted at all. This was the other brother of the two&mdash;Cyril, the
      painter, not Guy, the journalist.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the acute and experienced criminal hand recognised that this
      chance told unconsciously in his own favour. Like every other suspected
      person, he wanted time, and time would be taken up in proving an alibi for
      Cyril, as well as showing by concurrent proof that he was not his brother.
      Meanwhile, suspicion would fix itself still more firmly upon Guy, whose
      flight would give colour to the charges brought against him by the
      authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the great Q.C. determined to take up Cyril Waring&rsquo;s case as a
      labour of love, and didn&rsquo;t doubt he would succeed in finally proving
      it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. &mdash; WOMAN&rsquo;S INTUITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning, Cyril Waring appeared once more in the Sessions House for
      the preliminary investigation on the charge of murder. As he entered, a
      momentary hush pervaded the room; then, suddenly, from a seat beneath, a
      woman&rsquo;s voice burst forth, quite low, yet loud enough to be heard by
      all the magistrates on the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mother,&rdquo; it said, in a very tremulous tone, &ldquo;it
      isn&rsquo;t Guy himself at all; don&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s Cyril?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were so involuntarily spoken, and in such hushed awe and amaze,
      that even the magistrates themselves, hard Devonshire squires, didn&rsquo;t
      turn their heads to rebuke the speaker. As for Cyril, he had no need to
      look towards a blushing face in the body of the court to know that the
      voice was Elma Clifford&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat there looking lovelier than he had ever before seen her. Cyril&rsquo;s
      glance caught hers. They didn&rsquo;t need to speak. He saw at once in her
      eye that Elma at least knew instinctively he was innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment Gilbert Gildersleeve stood up to state his defence, and gazed
      at her steadily. As he rose in his place, Elma&rsquo;s eye met his.
      Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s fell. He didn&rsquo;t know why, but in that
      second of time the great blustering man felt certain in his heart that
      Elma Clifford suspected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma Clifford, for her part, knew still more than that. With the swift
      intuition she inherited from her long line of Oriental ancestry, she said
      to herself at once, in categorical terms, &ldquo;It was that man that did
      it. I know it was he. And he sees I know it. And he knows I&rsquo;m right.
      And he&rsquo;s afraid of me accordingly.&rdquo; But an intuition, however
      valuable to its possessor, is not yet admitted as evidence in English
      courts. Elma also knew it was no use in the world for her to get up in her
      place and say so openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Q.C. put his case in a nutshell. &ldquo;Our client,&rdquo; he
      contended, &ldquo;was NOT the man against whom the warrant in this case
      had been duly issued; he was NOT the man named Guy Waring; he was NOT the
      man whom the witnesses deposed to having seen at Mambury; he was NOT the
      man who had loitered with evil intent around the skirts of Dartmoor; in
      short,&rdquo; the great Q.C. observed, with demonstrative eye-glass,
      &ldquo;it was a very clear case of mistaken identity. It would take them
      time, no doubt, to prove the conclusive alibi they intended to establish;
      for the gentleman now charged before them, he would hope to show
      hereafter, was Mr. Cyril Waring, the distinguished painter, twin brother
      to Mr. Guy Waring, the journalist, against whom warrant was issued; and he
      was away in Belgium during the whole precise time when Mr. Guy Waring&mdash;as
      to whose guilt or innocence he would make no definite assertion&mdash;was
      prowling round Dartmoor on the trail of McGregor, alias Montague Nevitt.
      Therefore, they would consent to an indefinite remand till evidence to
      that effect was duly forthcoming. Meanwhile&mdash;&rdquo; and here Gilbert
      Gildersleeve&rsquo;s eyes fell upon Elma once more with a quiet forensic
      smile&mdash;he would call one witness, on the spur of the moment, whom he
      hadn&rsquo;t thought till that very morning of calling, but whom the
      magistrates would allow to be a very important one&mdash;a lady from
      Chetwood&mdash;Miss Elma Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma, taken aback, stood up in the box and gave her evidence timidly. It
      amounted to no more than the simple fact that the person before the
      magistrates was Cyril, not Guy; that the two brothers were extremely like;
      but that she had reason to know them easily apart, having been associated
      in a most painful accident in a tunnel with the brother, the present Mr.
      Cyril Waring. What she said gave only a presumption of mistaken identity,
      but didn&rsquo;t at all invalidate the positive identification of all the
      people who had seen the supposed murderer. However, from Gilbert
      Gildersleeve&rsquo;s point of view, this delay was doubly valuable. In the
      first place, it gave him time to prove his alibi for Cyril and bring
      witnesses from Belgium; and, in the second place, it succeeded in still
      further fastening public suspicion on Guy, and narrowing the question for
      the police to the simple issue whether or not they had really caught the
      brother who was seen at Mambury on the day of the murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law&rsquo;s delays were as marvellous as is their wont. It was a full
      fortnight before the barrister was able to prove his point by bringing
      over witnesses at considerable expense from Belgium and elsewhere, and by
      the aid of a few intimate friends in London, who could speak with
      certainty as to the difference between the two brothers. At the end of a
      fortnight, however, he did sufficiently prove it by tracing Cyril in
      detail from England to the Ardennes and back again to Dover, as well as by
      showing exactly how Guy had been employed in London and elsewhere on every
      day or night of the intervening period. The magistrates at last released
      Cyril, convinced by his arguments; and on the very same day, the coroner&rsquo;s
      inquest on Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s body, after adjourning time upon time
      to await the clearing up of this initial difficulty, returned a verdict of
      wilful murder against Guy Waring.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, in town, the most completely mystified person of all was a
      certain cashier of the London and West County Bank, in Lombard Street, who
      read in his St. James&rsquo;s this complete proof that Cyril had been in
      Belgium through all those days when he himself distinctly remembered
      cashing over the counter for him a cheque for no less a sum than six
      thousand pounds to &ldquo;self or bearer.&rdquo; Had the brothers, then,
      been deliberately and nefariously engaged in a deep-laid scheme&mdash;the
      cashier asked himself, much puzzled&mdash;to confuse one another&rsquo;s
      identity with great care beforehand, with a distinct view to the projected
      murder? For as yet, of course, nobody on earth except Guy Waring himself
      on the waters of Biscay knew or suspected anything at all about the
      forgery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma Clifford and her mother, meanwhile, had stopped on at Tavistock till
      Cyril was released from his close confinement. Elma never meant to marry
      him, of course&mdash;to that prime determination she still remained firm
      as a rock under all conditions&mdash;but in such straits as those, why,
      naturally she couldn&rsquo;t bear to be far away from him. So she remained
      at Tavistock quietly till the inquiry was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of his release Elma met him at the hotel. Her mother had
      gone out on purpose to leave them alone. Elma took Cyril&rsquo;s hand in
      hers with a profound trembling. She felt the moment for reserve had long
      gone past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cyril,&rdquo; she said, boldly calling him by his Christian name,
      because she could call him only as she always thought of him, &ldquo;I
      knew from the first you didn&rsquo;t do it. And just because I know you
      didn&rsquo;t, I know Guy didn&rsquo;t either, though everything looks now
      so very black against him. I can trust YOU, and I can trust HIM. All
      through, I&rsquo;ve never had a doubt one moment of either of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril held her hand in his, and raised it tenderly to his lips. Elma
      looked at him, half surprised. Only her hand, how strange of him. Cyril
      read the unspoken thought, as she would have read it herself, and answered
      quickly, &ldquo;Never, Elma, now, till Guy has cleared himself of this
      deadly accusation. I couldn&rsquo;t bear to ask you to accept a man who
      every one else would call a murderer&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma gazed at him steadfastly. Tears stood in her eyes. Her voice
      trembled; but she was very firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must clear you and him of this dreadful charge,&rdquo; she said
      slowly. &ldquo;I know we must do that, Cyril. Guy didn&rsquo;t kill him.
      Guy&rsquo;s wholly incapable of it. But where is Guy now? That&rsquo;s
      what I don&rsquo;t understand. We must clear that all up. Though, even
      when it&rsquo;s cleared up, I can only LOVE you. As I told you that day at
      Chetwood&mdash;and I mean it still&mdash;whatever comes to us two, I can
      never, never marry you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even if I clear this all up?&rdquo; Cyril asked, with a wistful
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even if you clear this all up,&rdquo; Elma answered seriously.
      &ldquo;The difficulty&rsquo;s on MY side, don&rsquo;t you see, not on
      yours at all. So far as you&rsquo;re concerned, Cyril, clear this up or
      leave it just where it is, I&rsquo;d marry you to-morrow. I&rsquo;d marry
      you at once, and proud to do it, if only to show the world openly I trust
      you both. I half faltered just once as you stood there in court, whether I
      wouldn&rsquo;t say yes to you, for nothing else but that&mdash;to let
      everybody see how implicitly I trusted you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t allow it,&rdquo; Cyril answered, all
      aglow. &ldquo;As things stand now, Elma, our positions are reversed. While
      this cloud still hangs so black over Guy, I couldn&rsquo;t find it in my
      conscience to ask you to marry me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at her steadily. They were both too profoundly stirred for tears
      or emotions. A quiet despair gleamed in the eyes of each. Cyril could
      never marry her till he had cleared up this mystery. Elma could never
      marry him, even if it were all cleared up, with that terrible taint of
      madness, as she thought it, hanging threateningly for ever over her and
      her family.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused for a minute or two, with her hand locked in his. Then she said
      once more, very low, &ldquo;No, Guy didn&rsquo;t do it. But why did he run
      away? That baffles me quite. That&rsquo;s the one point of it all that
      makes it so strange and so terribly mysterious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elma,&rdquo; Cyril answered, with a cold thrill, &ldquo;I believe
      in Guy; I think I know myself, and I think I know him, well enough to say
      that such a thing as murder is impossible for either of us. He&rsquo;s
      weak at times, I admit, and his will was powerless before the magnetic
      force of Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s. But when I try to face that inscrutable
      mystery of why, if he&rsquo;s innocent, he has run away from this charge,
      I confess my faith begins to falter and tremble. He must have seen it in
      the papers. He must have seen I was accused. What can he mean by leaving
      me to bear it in his stead without ever coming forward to help me fairly
      out of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma looked up at him with another of her sudden flashes of superb
      intuition. &ldquo;He CAN&rsquo;T have seen it in the papers,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;That gives us some clue. If he&rsquo;d seen it, he MUST have
      come forward to help you. But, Cyril, MY faith never falters at all. And I
      tell you why. Not only do I know Guy didn&rsquo;t do it, but I know who
      did it. The man who murdered Montague Nevitt is&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t
      I tell you?&mdash;Mr. Gilbert Gildersleeve!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril started back astonished. &ldquo;Oh, Elma, why do you think so?&rdquo;
      he cried in amazement. &ldquo;What possible reason can you have for saying
      so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; Elma answered, with a calmly resigned air. &ldquo;I
      only know it; I know it from his eyes. I looked in them once and read it
      like a book. But of course that&rsquo;s nothing. What we must do now is to
      try and find out the facts. I looked in his eyes and I saw it at a glance.
      And I saw he saw it. He knows I&rsquo;ve discovered him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril half drew away from her with a faint sense of alarm. &ldquo;Elma,&rdquo;
      he said slowly, &ldquo;I believe in Guy; but really and truly I can&rsquo;t
      quite believe THAT. You make your intuition tell you far too much. In your
      natural anxiety to screen my brother, you&rsquo;ve fixed the guilt,
      without proof, upon another innocent man. I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Gildersleeve&rsquo;s
      as incapable as Guy of any such action.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure of it, too,&rdquo; Elma answered, with the
      instinctive certainty of feminine conviction. &ldquo;But still I know, for
      all that, he did it. Perhaps it was all done in a moment of haste. But at
      least he did it. And nothing on earth that anybody could say will ever
      make me believe he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Clifford came back to the hotel an hour later, she scanned her
      daughter&rsquo;s face with a keen glance of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he says he won&rsquo;t ask you again,&rdquo; she murmured,
      laying Elma&rsquo;s head on her shoulder, &ldquo;till this case is cleared
      up, and Guy is proved innocent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Elma answered, nestling close and looking red as a
      rose. &ldquo;He knows very well Guy didn&rsquo;t do it, but he wants all
      the rest of the world to acknowledge it also.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And YOU know who did it?&rdquo; Mrs. Clifford said, with a
      tentative air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother. Do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do, darling. But it&rsquo;ll never be proved against
      HIM, you may be sure. I saw it at a glance. It&rsquo;s Mr. Gilbert
      Gildersleeve.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. &mdash; FRESH DISCOVERIES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Cyril drove home from Waterloo next day to his lonely rooms in Staple
      Inn, Holborn, he turned aside with his cab for a few minutes to make a
      passing call at the bank in Lombard Street. He was short of ready money,
      and wanted to cash a cheque for fifty pounds for expenses incurred in his
      defence at Tavistock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cashier stared at him hard; then, without consulting anybody, he said,
      in a somewhat embarrassed tone, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re
      aware of it, Mr. Waring, but this overdraws your current account. We haven&rsquo;t
      fifty pounds on our books to your credit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was well posted on the subject, in fact, for only that morning he had
      hunted up Cyril&rsquo;s balance in the ledger at his side for the
      gratification of his own pure personal curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril stared at him in astonishment. In this age of surprises, one more
      surprise was thus suddenly sprung upon him. His first impulse was to
      exclaim in a very amazed voice, &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve six thousand odd
      pounds to my credit, surely;&rdquo; but he checked himself in time with a
      violent effort. How could he tell what strange things might have happened
      in his absence? If the money was gone, and Nevitt was murdered, and Guy in
      hiding, who could say what fresh complications might not still be in store
      for him? So he merely answered, with a strenuous endeavour to suppress his
      agitation, &ldquo;Will you kindly let me have my balance-sheet, if you
      please? I&mdash;ur&mdash;I thought I&rsquo;d more money than that still
      left with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cashier brought out a big book and a bundle of cheques, which he
      handed to Cyril with a face of profound interest. To him, too, this little
      drama was pregnant with mystery and personal implications. Cyril turned
      the vouchers over one by one, with close attention, recognising the
      signature and occasion of each, till he arrived at last at a big cheque
      which staggered him sadly for a moment. He took it up in his hands and
      examined it in the light. &ldquo;Pay Self or Bearer, Six Thousand Pounds
      (L6,000), Cyril Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, horrible, horrible! This, then, was the secret of Guy&rsquo;s sudden
      disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t cry aloud. He didn&rsquo;t say a word. He looked at the
      thing hard, and knew in a moment exactly what had happened. Guy had forged
      that cheque; it was Guy&rsquo;s natural hand, written forward like Cyril&rsquo;s
      own, instead of backward, as usual. And no one but himself could possibly
      have told it from his own true signature. But Cyril knew it at once for
      Guy&rsquo;s by one infallible sign&mdash;a tiny sign that might escape the
      veriest expert&mdash;some faint hesitation about the tail of the capital
      C, which was shorter in Guy&rsquo;s hand than Cyril ever made it, and
      which Guy had therefore deliberately lengthened, by an effort or an
      afterthought, to complete the imitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cashed that cheque yourself, sir, over the counter, you
      remember,&rdquo; the cashier said quietly, &ldquo;on the date it was drawn
      on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril never altered a muscle of his rigid face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, quite so,&rdquo; he answered, in a very dry voice, not daring
      to contradict the man. He knew just what had happened. Guy must have come
      to get the money himself, and the cashier must have mistaken him for the
      proper owner of the purloined six thousand. They were so very much alike.
      Nobody ever distinguished them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was one of the days, I think, when you proved the alibi in
      Belgium before the Devonshire magistrates at Tavistock yesterday,&rdquo;
      the clerk went on, with a searching glance. Cyril started this time. He
      saw in a second the new danger thus sprung upon him. If the cashier chose
      to press the matter home to the hilt, he must necessarily arrive at one or
      other of two results. Either the alibi would break down altogether, or it
      would be perfectly clear that Guy had committed a forgery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; he answered, looking his keen interlocutor
      straight in the eyes. &ldquo;So it seems, I should say, by the date on the
      face of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cashier did NOT care to press the matter home any further; and for
      a very good reason. It was none of his business to suggest the idea of a
      forgery, after a cheque had been presented and duly cashed, if the
      customer to whose account it was debited in course chose voluntarily to
      accept the responsibility of honouring it. The objection should come first
      from the customer&rsquo;s side. If HE didn&rsquo;t care to press it, then
      neither did the cashier. Why should he, indeed? Why saddle his firm with
      six thousand pounds loss? He would only get himself into trouble for
      having failed to observe the discrepancy in the signatures, and the
      difference between the brothers. That, after all, is what a cashier is
      for. If he doesn&rsquo;t fulfil those first duties of his post, why what
      on earth can be the good of him to anybody in any way?
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked at one another across the counter with a strong
      inscrutable stare of mutual suspicion. Then Cyril slowly tore up the
      cheque he had tendered for fifty pounds, filled in another for his real
      balance of twenty-two, handed it across to the clerk without another word,
      received the cash in white trembling hands, and went out to his cab again
      in a turmoil of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way back to his rooms in Staple Inn one seething idea alone
      possessed his soul. His faith in Guy was beginning to break down. And with
      it, his faith in himself almost went. The man was his own brother&mdash;his
      very counterpart, he knew; could he really believe him capable of
      committing a murder? Cyril looked within, and said a thousand times NO; he
      looked at that forged cheque, and his heart misgave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Staple Inn, the housekeeper who took care of their joint rooms came out
      to greet him with no small store of tears and lamentations. &ldquo;Oh, Mr.
      Cyril,&rdquo; she cried, seizing both his hands in hers with a tremulous
      welcome, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you back, and to know you&rsquo;re
      innocent. I always said you never could have done it; no, no, not you, nor
      yet Mr. Guy neither. The police has been here time and again to search the
      rooms, but, the Lord be praised, they never found anything. And I&rsquo;ve
      got a letter for you, too, from Mr. Guy himself; but there&mdash;I locked
      it up till you come in my own cupboard at home, for fear of the
      detectives; and now you&rsquo;re back and safe in London again, I&rsquo;ll
      run home this minute round the corner and get it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril sat down in the familiar easy-chair, holding his face in his hands,
      and gazed about him blankly. Such a home-coming as this was inexpressibly
      terrible to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes more the housekeeper came back, bringing in her hand Guy&rsquo;s
      letter from Plymouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril sat for a minute and looked at the envelope in deadly silence. Then
      he motioned the housekeeper out of the room with one quivering hand.
      Before that good woman&rsquo;s face, he couldn&rsquo;t open it and read
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she was gone, he tore it apart, trembling. As he read and read
      the suspicion within him deepened quickly into a doubt, the doubt into a
      conviction, the conviction into a certainty. He clapped his hands to his
      head. Oh, God, what was this? Guy acknowledged his own guilt! He confessed
      he had done it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril&rsquo;s last hope was gone. Guy himself admitted it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How I came to do it,&rdquo; the letter said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no
      idea myself. A sudden suggestion&mdash;a strange, unaccountable impulse&mdash;a
      prompting, as it were, pressed upon me from without, and almost before I
      knew, the crime was committed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril bent his head low upon his knees with shame. He never could hold up
      that head henceforth. No further doubt or hesitation remained. He knew the
      whole truth. Guy was indeed a murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He steeled himself for the worst, and read the letter through with a
      superhuman effort. It almost choked him to read. The very consecutiveness
      and coherency of the sentences seemed all but incredible under such awful
      circumstances. A murderer, red-handed, to speak of his crime so calmly as
      that! And then, too, this undying anger expressed and felt, even after
      death, against his victim Nevitt! Cyril couldn&rsquo;t understand how any
      man&mdash;least of all his own brother&mdash;could write such words about
      the murdered man whose body was then lying all silent and cold, under the
      open sky, among the bracken at Mambury.
    </p>
    <p>
      And once more, this awful clue of the dead man&rsquo;s pocket-book! Those
      accursed notes! That hateful sum of money! How could Guy venture to speak
      of it all in such terms as those&mdash;the one palpable fact that
      indubitably linked him with that cold-blooded murder. &ldquo;The three
      thousand sent herewith I recovered, almost by a miracle, from that false
      creature&rsquo;s grasp, under extraordinary circumstances, and I return
      them now, in proof of the fact, in Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s own
      pocket-book, which I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll recognise as soon as you
      look at it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril saw it all now beyond the shadow of a doubt. He reconstructed the
      whole sad tale. He was sure he understood it. But to understand it was
      hardly even yet to believe it. Guy had lost heavily in the Rio Negro
      Mines, as the prosecution declared; in an evil hour he&rsquo;d been
      cajoled into forging Cyril&rsquo;s name for six thousand. Montague Nevitt
      had in some way misappropriated the stolen sum. Guy had pursued him in a
      sudden white-heat of fury, had come up with him unawares, had killed him
      in his rage, and now calmly returned as much as he could recover of that
      fateful and twice-stolen money to Cyril. It was all too horrible, but all
      too true. In a wild ferment of remorse for his brother&rsquo;s sin, the
      unhappy painter sat down at once and penned a letter of abject
      self-humiliation to Elma Clifford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ELMA,-I said to you last night that I could never marry you till I
      had clearly proved my brother Guy&rsquo;s innocence. Well, I said what I
      can never conceivably do. Since returning to town I received a letter from
      Guy himself. What it contained I must never tell you, for Guy&rsquo;s own
      sake. But what I MUST tell you is this&mdash;I can never again see you.
      Guy and I are so nearly one, in every nerve and fibre of our being, that
      whatever he may have done is to me almost as if I myself had done it. You
      will know how terrible a thing it is for me to write these words, but for
      YOUR sake I can&rsquo;t refrain from writing them. Think no more of me. I
      am not worthy of you. I will think of you as long as I live.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ever devoted and heart-broken
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;CYRIL.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      He folded the letter, and sent it off to the temporary address at the
      West-End where Elma had told him that she and her mother would spend the
      night in London. Very late that evening a ring came at the bell. Cyril ran
      to the door. It was a boy with a telegram. He opened it, and read it with
      breathless excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever Guy may have said, you are quite mistaken. There&rsquo;s a
      mystery somewhere. Keep his letter and show it to me. I may, perhaps, be
      able to unravel the tangle. I&rsquo;m more than ever convinced that what I
      said to you last night was perfectly true. We will save him yet.
      Unalterably,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;ELMA.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      But the telegram brought little peace to Cyril. Of what value were Elma&rsquo;s
      vague intuitions now, by the side of Guy&rsquo;s own positive confession?
      With his very own hand Guy admitted that he had done it. Cyril went to bed
      that night, the unhappiest, loneliest man in London. What Guy was, he was.
      He felt himself almost like the actual murderer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI. &mdash; &ldquo;GOLDEN JOYS.&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p>
      The voyage to the Cape was long and tedious. On the whole way out, Guy
      made but few friends, and talked very little to his fellow passengers.
      That unhappy recognition by Granville Kelmscott the evening he went on
      board the Cetewayo poisoned the fugitive&rsquo;s mind for the entire
      passage. He felt himself, in fact, a moral outcast; he slunk away from his
      kind; he hardly dared to meet Kelmscott&rsquo;s eyes for shame, whenever
      he passed him. But for one thing at least he was truly grateful. Though
      Kelmscott had evidently discovered from the papers the nature of Guy&rsquo;s
      crime, and knew his real name well, it was clear he had said nothing of
      any sort on the subject to the other passengers. Only one man on board was
      aware of his guilt, Guy believed, and that one man he shunned accordingly
      as far as was possible within the narrow limits of the saloon and the
      quarter-deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville Kelmscott, of course, took a very different view of Guy Waring&rsquo;s
      position. He had read in the paper he bought at Plymouth that Guy was the
      murderer of Montague Nevitt. Regarding him, therefore, as a criminal of
      the deepest dye now flying from justice, he wasn&rsquo;t at all surprised
      at Guy&rsquo;s shrinking and shunning him; what astonished him rather was
      the man&rsquo;s occasional and incredible fits of effrontery. How that
      fellow could ever laugh and talk at all among the ladies on deck&mdash;with
      the hangman at his back&mdash;simply appalled and horrified the proud soul
      of a Kelmscott. Granville had hard work to keep from expressing his horror
      openly at times. But still, with an effort, he kept his peace. With the
      picture of his father and Lady Emily now strong before his mind, he couldn&rsquo;t
      find it in his heart to bring his own half-brother, however guilty and
      criminal the man might be, to the foot of the gallows.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they voyaged on together without once interchanging a single word, all
      the way from Plymouth to the Cape Colony. And the day they landed at Port
      Elizabeth, it was an infinite relief indeed to Guy to think he could now
      get well away for ever from that fellow Kelmscott. Not being by any means
      over-burdened with ready cash, however, Guy determined to waste no time in
      the coastwise towns, but to make his way at once boldly up country towards
      Kimberley. The railway ran then only as far as Grahamstown; the rest of
      his journey to the South African Golconda was accomplished by road, in a
      two-wheeled cart, drawn by four small horses, which rattled along with a
      will, up hill and down dale, over the precarious highways of that
      semi-civilized upland.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Guy, just fresh from England and the monotonous sea, there was a
      certain exhilaration in this first hasty glimpse of the infinite
      luxuriance of sub-tropical nature. At times he almost forgot Montague
      Nevitt and the forgery in the boundless sense of freedom and novelty given
      him by those vast wastes of rolling tableland, thickly covered with grass
      or low thorny acacias, and stretching illimitably away in low range after
      range to the blue mountains in the distance. It was strange indeed to him
      on the wide plains through which they scurried in wild haste to see the
      springbok rush away from the doubtful track at the first whirr of their
      wheels, or the bolder bustard stand and gaze among the long grass, with
      his wary eye turned sideways to look at them. Guy felt for the moment he
      had left Europe and its reminiscences now fairly behind him; in this free
      new world, he was free once more himself; his shame was cast aside; he
      could revel like the antelopes in the immensity of a land where nobody
      knew him and he knew nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      What added most of all, however, to this quaint new sense of vastness and
      freedom was the occasional appearance of naked blacks, roaming at large
      through the burnt-up fields of which till lately they had been undisputed
      possessors. Day after day Guy drove on along the uncertain roads, past
      queer outlying towns of white wooden houses&mdash;Cradock, and Middelburg,
      and Colesberg, and others&mdash;till they crossed at last the boundary of
      Orange River into the Free State, and halted for a while in the main
      street of Philippolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dreary place; Guy began now to see the other side of South
      Africa. Though he had left England in autumn, it was spring-time at the
      Cape, and the winter drought had parched up all the grass, leaving the
      bare red dust in the roads or streets as dry and desolate as the sand of
      the desert. The town itself consisted of some sixty melancholy and
      distressful houses, bare, square, and flat-roofed, standing unenclosed
      along a dismal high-road, and with that congenitally shabby look, in spite
      of their newness, which seems to belong by nature to all southern
      buildings. Some stagnant pools alone remained to attest the presence after
      rain of a roaring brook, the pits in whose dried-up channel they now
      occupied; over their tops hung the faded foliage of a few dust-laden
      trees, struggling hard for life with the energy of despair against
      depressing circumstances. It was a picture that gave Guy a sudden attack
      of pessimism; if THIS was the El Dorado towards which he was going, he
      earnestly wished himself back again once more, forgery or no forgery,
      among the breezy green fields of dear old England.
    </p>
    <p>
      On to Fauresmith he travelled with less comfort than before in a rickety
      buggy of most primitive construction, designed to meet the needs of rough
      mountain roads, and as innocent of springs as Guy himself of the murder of
      Montague Nevitt. It was a wretched drive. The drought had now broken; the
      wet season had begun; rain fell heavily. A piercing cold wind blew down
      from the nearer mountains; and Guy began to feel still more acutely than
      ever that South Africa was by no means an earthly paradise. As he drove on
      and on this feeling deepened upon him. Huge blocks of stone obstructed the
      rough road, intersected as it was by deep cart-wheel ruts, down which the
      rain-water now flowed in impromptu torrents. The Dutch driver, too,
      anxious to show the mettle of his coarse-limbed steeds, persisted in
      dashing over the hummocky ground at a break-neck pace, while Guy balanced
      himself with difficulty on the narrow seat, hanging on to his portmanteau
      for dear life among the jerks and jolts, till his ringers were numbed with
      cold and exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      They held out against it all, before the pelting rain, till man and beast
      were well-nigh exhausted. At last, about three-quarters of the way to
      Fauresmith, on the bleak bare hill-tops, sleety snow began to fall in big
      flakes, and the barking of a dog to be heard in the distance. The Boer
      driver pricked up his ears at the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must a house be,&rdquo; he remarked in his Dutch
      pigeon-English to Guy; and Guy felt in his soul that the most miserable
      and filthy of Kaffir huts would just then be a welcome sight to his weary
      eyes. He would have given a sovereign, indeed, from the scanty store he
      possessed, for a night&rsquo;s lodging in a convenient dog-kennel. He was
      agreeably surprised, therefore, to find it was a comfortable farmhouse,
      where the lights in the casement beamed forth a cheery welcome on the wet
      and draggled wayfarers from real glass windows. The farmer within received
      them hospitably. Business was brisk to-day. Another traveller, he said,
      had just gone on towards Fauresmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young man like yourself, fresh from England,&rdquo; the farmer
      observed, scanning Guy closely. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s off for the diamond
      diggings. I think to Dutoitspan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy rested the right there, thinking nothing of the stranger, and went on
      next day more quietly to Fauresmith. Thence to the diamond fields, the
      country became at each step more sombre and more monotonous than ever. In
      the afternoon they rested at Jacobsdal, another dusty, dreary, comfortless
      place, consisting of about five and twenty bankrupt houses scattered in
      bare clumps over a scorched-up desert. Then on again next day, over a
      drearier and ever drearier expanse of landscape. It was ghastly. It was
      horrible. At last, on the top of a dismal hill range, looking down on a
      deep dale, the driver halted. In the vast flat below, a dull dense fog
      seemed to envelop the world with inscrutable mists. The driver pointed to
      it with his demonstrative whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down yonder,&rdquo; he said encouragingly, as he put the skid on
      his wheel, &ldquo;down yonder&rsquo;s the diamond fields&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      Dutoitspan before you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes it so grey?&rdquo; Guy asked, looking in front of him
      with a sinking heart. This first view of his future home was by no means
      encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the sand make it be like that,&rdquo; the driver answered
      unconcernedly. &ldquo;Diamond fields all make up of fine red sand; and
      diggers pile it about around their own claims. Then the wind comes and
      blow, and make sandstorm always around Dutoitspan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy groaned inwardly. This was certainly NOT the El Dorado of his fancy.
      They descended the hill, at the same break-neck pace as before, and
      entered the miserable mushroom town of diamond-grubbers. Amidst the huts
      in the diggings great heaps of red earth lay piled up everywhere. Dust and
      sand rose high on the hot breeze into the stifling air. As they reached
      the encampment&mdash;for Dutoitspan then was little more than a camp&mdash;the
      blinding mists of solid red particles drove so thick in their eyes that
      Guy could hardly see a few yards before him. Their clothes and faces were
      literally encrusted in thick coats of dust. The fine red mist seemed to
      pervade everything. It filled their eyes, their nostrils, their ears,
      their mouths. They breathed solid dust. The air was laden deep with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And THIS was the diamond fields! This was the Golconda where Guy was to
      find six thousand pounds ready made to recover his losses and to repay
      Cyril. Oh, horrible, horrible. His heart sank low at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still they went on, and on, and on, and on, through the mist of dust
      to the place for out-spanning. Guy only shared the common fate of all
      new-comers to &ldquo;the fields&rdquo; in feeling much distressed and
      really ill. The very horses in the cart snorted and sneezed and showed
      their high displeasure by trying every now and then to jib and turn back
      again. Here and there, on either side, to right and left, where the gloom
      permitted it, Guy made out dimly a few round or oblong tents, with
      occasional rude huts of corrugated iron. A few uncertain figures lounged
      vaguely in the background. On closer inspection they proved to be
      much-grimed and half-naked natives, resting their weary limbs on piles of
      dry dust after their toil in the diggings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an unearthly scene. Guy&rsquo;s heart sank lower and lower still at
      every step the horses took into that howling wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the driver drew up with a jolt in front of a long low hut of
      corrugated iron, somewhat larger than the rest, but no less dull and
      dreary. &ldquo;The hotel,&rdquo; he said briefly; and Guy jumped out to
      secure himself a night&rsquo;s lodging or so at this place of
      entertainment, till he could negotiate for a hut and a decent claim, and
      commence his digging.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bar of the primitive saloon where he found himself landed, a man in
      a grey tweed suit was already seated. He was drinking something fizzy from
      a tall soda-water glass. With a sudden start of horror Guy recognised him
      at once. Oh, great heavens, what was this? It was Granville Kelmscott!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Granville, too, was bound for the diamond fields like himself. What
      an incredible coincidence! How strange! How inexplicable! That rich man&rsquo;s
      son, the pampered heir to Tilgate! what could HE be doing here, in this
      out-of-the-way spot, this last resort of poor broken-down men, this
      miserable haunt of wretched gambling money-grubbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here curiosity, surely, must have drawn him to the spot. He couldn&rsquo;t
      have come to DIG! Guy gazed in amazement at that grey tweed suit. He must
      be staying for a day or two in search of adventure. No more than just
      that! He couldn&rsquo;t mean to STOP here.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he gazed and stood open-mouthed in the shadow of the door, Granville
      Kelmscott, who hadn&rsquo;t seen him enter, laid down his glass, wiped his
      lips with gusto, and continued his conversation with the complacent
      barman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I want a hut here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and to buy a good
      claim. I&rsquo;ve been looking over the kopje down by Watson&rsquo;s spare
      land, and I think I&rsquo;ve seen a lot that&rsquo;s likely to suit me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy could hardly restrain his astonishment and surprise. He had come,
      then, to dig! Oh, incredible! impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      But at any rate this settled his own immediate movements. Guy&rsquo;s mind
      was made up at once. If Granville Kelmscott was going to dig at Dutoitspan&mdash;why,
      clearly Dutoitspan was no place for HIM. He could never stand the
      continual presence of the one man in South Africa who knew his deadly
      secret. Come what might he must leave the neighbourhood without a moment&rsquo;s
      delay. He must strike out at once for the far interior. As he paused,
      Granville Kelmscott turned round and saw him. Their eyes met with a start.
      Each was equally astonished. Then Granville rose slowly from his seat, and
      murmured in a low voice, as he regarded him fixedly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here again, Mr. Billington! This is once too often. I hardly
      expected THIS. There&rsquo;s no room here for both of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he strode from the saloon, with a very black brow, leaving Guy for the
      moment alone with the barman.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII. &mdash; A NEW DEPARTURE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A fortnight later, one sultry afternoon, Granville Kelmscott found
      himself, after various strange adventures and escapes by the way, in a
      Koranna hut, far in the untravelled heart of the savage Barolong country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tenement where he sat, or more precisely squatted, was by no means
      either a commodious or sweet-scented one. Yet it was the biggest of a
      group on the river-bank, some five feet high from floor to roof, so that a
      Kelmscott couldn&rsquo;t possibly stand erect at full length in it; and it
      was roughly round in shape, like an overgrown beehive, the framework
      consisting of branches of trees, arranged in a rude circle, over whose
      arching ribs native rush mats had been thrown or sewn with irregular
      order. The door was a hole, through which the proud descendant of the
      squires of Tilgate had to creep on all fours; a hollow pit dug out in the
      centre served as the only fireplace; smoke and stagnant air formed the
      staples of the atmosphere. A more squalid hovel Granville Kelmscott had
      never even conceived as possible. It was as dirty and as loathsome as the
      most vivid imagination could picture the hut of the lowest savages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet here that delicately nurtured English gentleman was to be cooped up
      for an indefinite time, as it seemed, by order of the black despot who
      ruled over the Barolong with a rod of iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had led Granville Kelmscott into this extraordinary scrape it would
      not be hard to say. The Kelmscott nature, in all its embodiments, worked
      on very simple but very fixed lines. The moment Granville saw his
      half-brother Guy at Dutoitspan, his mind was made up at once as to his
      immediate procedure. He wouldn&rsquo;t stop one day&mdash;one hour longer
      than necessary where he could see that fellow who committed the murder.
      Come what might, he would make his escape at once into the far interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      As before in England, so now in Africa, both brothers were moved by the
      self-same impulses. And each carried them out with characteristic
      promptitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where could Granville go, however? Well, it was rumoured at Dutoitspan
      that &ldquo;pebbles&rdquo; had been found far away to the north in the
      Barolong country. &ldquo;Pebbles,&rdquo; of course, is good South African
      for diamonds; and at this welcome news all Kimberley and Griqualand
      pricked up their ears with congenial delight; for business was growing
      flat on the old-established diamond fields. The palmy era of great finds
      and lucky hits was now long past; the day of systematic and prosaic
      industry had set in instead for the over-stocked diggings. It was no
      longer possible for the luckiest fresh hand to pick up pebbles lying loose
      on the surface; the mode of working had become highly skilled and
      scientific.
    </p>
    <p>
      Machines and scaffolds, and washing-cradles and lifting apparatus were now
      required to make the business a success; the simple old gambling element
      was rapidly going out, and the capitalist was rapidly coming up in its
      stead as master of the situation. So Granville Kelmscott, being an
      enterprising young man, though destitute of cash, and utterly ignorant of
      South African life, determined to push on with all his might and main into
      the Barolong country, and to rush for the front among the first in the
      field in these rumoured new diggings on the extreme north frontier of
      civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started alone, as a Kelmscott might do, and made his way adventurously,
      without any knowledge of the Koranna language or manners, through many
      wild villages of King Khatsua&rsquo;s dominions. Night after night he
      camped out in the open; and day after day he tramped on by himself, buying
      food as he went from the natives for English silver, in search of precious
      stones, over that dreary tableland. At last, on the fourteenth day, in a
      deep alluvial hollow near a squalid group of small Barolong huts, he saw a
      tiny round stone, much rubbed and water-worn, which he picked up and
      examined with no little curiosity. The two days he had spent at Dutoitspan
      had not been wasted. He had learnt to recognise the look of the native
      gem. Once glance told him at once what his pebble was. He recognised it at
      sight as one of those small but much-valued diamonds of the finest water,
      which diggers know by the technical name of &ldquo;glass-stones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hollow where he stood was in fact an ancient alluvial pit or volcanic
      mud-crater. Scoriac rubble filled it in to a very great depth; and in the
      interstices of this rubble were embedded here and there rude blocks of
      greenstone, containing almond-shaped chalcedonies and agate and
      milk-quartz, with now and then a tiny water-worn spec which an experienced
      eye would have detected at once as the finest &ldquo;riverstones.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here indeed was a prize! The solitary Englishman recognised in a second
      that he was the first pioneer of a new and richer Kimberley.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as Granville Kelmscott stood still, looking hard at his find through
      the little pocket-lens he had brought with him from England, with a
      justifiable tremor of delight at the pleasant thought that here, perhaps,
      he had lighted on the key to something which might restore him once more
      to his proper place at Tilgate, he was suddenly roused from his delightful
      reverie by a harsh negro voice, shrill and clear, close behind him,
      saying, in very tolerable African-English&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hillo, you white man! what dat you got there? You come here to
      Barolong land, so go look for diamond?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville turned sharply round, and saw standing by his side a naked and
      stalwart black man, smiling blandly at his discovery with broad negro
      amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pebble,&rdquo; the Englishman said, pocketing it as
      carelessly as he could, and trying to look unconcerned, for his new
      acquaintance held a long native spear in his stout left hand, and looked
      by no means the sort of person to be lightly trifled with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dat a pebble, mistah white man!&rdquo; the Barolong said
      sarcastically, holding out his black right hand with a very imperious air.
      &ldquo;Den you please hand him over dat pebble you find. Me got me orders.
      King Khatsua no want any diamond digging in Barolong land.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville tried to parley with the categorical native; but his attempts at
      palaver were eminently unsuccessful. The naked black man was master of the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hand over dat stone, me friend,&rdquo; he said, assuming a
      menacing attitude, and holding out his hand once more with no very gentle
      air, &ldquo;or me run you trew de body wit me assegai&mdash;just so! King
      Khatsua, him no want any diamond diggings in Barolong land.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, Granville Kelmscott couldn&rsquo;t help admitting to himself,
      when he came to think of it, that King Khatsua was acting wisely in his
      generation. For the introduction of diggers into his dominions would
      surely have meant, as everywhere else, the speedy proclamation of a
      British protectorate, and the final annihilation of King Khatsua himself
      and his dusky fellow-countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing, to say the truth, the South African native dreads so
      much as being &ldquo;eaten up,&rdquo; as he calls it, by those aggressive
      English. King Khatsua knew his one chance in life consisted in keeping the
      diggers firmly out of his dominions; and he was prepared to deny the very
      existence of diamonds throughout the whole of Barolong land, until the
      English, by sheer force, should come in flocks and unearth them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In obedience to his chief&rsquo;s command, therefore, the naked henchman
      still held out his hand menacingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dis land King Khatsua&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he repeated once more, in an
      angry voice. &ldquo;All diamonds found on it belong to King Khatsua. Just
      you hand dat over. No steal; no tief-ee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The instincts of the land-owning class were too strong in Granville
      Kelmscott not to make him admit at once to himself the justice of this
      claim. The owner of the soil had a right to the diamonds. He handed over
      the stone with a pang of regret. The savage grinned to himself, and
      scanned it attentively. Then extending his spear, as one might do to a cow
      or a sheep, he drove Granville before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come along a&rsquo; me,&rdquo; he said shortly, in a most
      determined voice. &ldquo;You come along a&rsquo; me. King Khatsua&rsquo;s
      orders.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville went before him without one word of remonstrance, much wondering
      what was likely to happen next, till he found himself suddenly driven into
      that noisome hut, where he was forced to enter ignominiously on all fours,
      like an eight months&rsquo; old baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the light of the fire that burned dimly in the midst of his captor&rsquo;s
      house he could see, as his eyes grew gradually accustomed to the murky
      gloom, a strange and savage scene, such as he had never before in his life
      dreamt of. In the pit of the hut some embers glowed feebly, from whose
      midst a fleecy object was sputtering and hissing. A second glance assured
      him that the savoury morsel was the head of an antelope in process of
      roasting. Two greasy black women, naked to the waist, were superintending
      this primitive cookery; all round, a group of unclad little imps, as black
      as their mothers, lounged idly about, with their eyes firmly fixed on the
      chance of dinner. As Granville entered, the husband and father, poking in
      his head, shouted a few words after him. Another native outside kept watch
      and ward with a spear at the door meanwhile, to prevent his escape against
      King Khatsua&rsquo;s orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two long hours the Englishman waited there, fretting and fuming, in
      that stifling atmosphere. Meanwhile, the antelope&rsquo;s head was fully
      cooked, and the women and children falling on it like wild beasts, tore
      off the scorched fleece and snatched the charred flesh from the bones with
      their fingers greedily. It was a hideous sight; it sickened him to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By&mdash;and&mdash;by Granville heard a loud voice outside. He listened in
      surprise. It sounded as though Barolong had another prisoner. There was a
      pause and a scuffle. Then, all of a sudden, somebody else came bundling
      unceremoniously through the hole that served for a door, in the same
      undignified fashion as he himself had done. Granville&rsquo;s eyes, now
      accustomed to the gloom, recognised the stranger at once with a thrill of
      astonishment. He could hardly trust his senses at the sight. It was&mdash;no,
      it couldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;yes, it was&mdash;Guy Waring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy Waring, sure enough; as before, they were companions. The Kelmscott
      character had worked itself out exactly alike in each of them. They had
      come independently by the self-same road to the rumoured diamond fields of
      the Barolong country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some minutes, however, before Guy, for his part, recognised his
      fellow-prisoner in the dark and gloomy hut. Then each stared at the other
      in mute surprise. They found no words to speak their mutual astonishment.
      This was more wonderful, to be sure, than even either of their former
      encounters.
    </p>
    <p>
      For another long hour the two unfriendly English-men huddled away from one
      another in opposite corners of that native hut, without speaking a word of
      any sort in their present straits. At the end of that time, a voice spoke
      at the door some guttural sentences in the Barolong language. The natives
      inside responded alike in their own savage clicks. Next the voice spoke in
      English; it was Granville&rsquo;s captor, he now knew well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White men, you come out; King Khatsua himself, him go to &lsquo;peak
      to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They crawled out, one at a time, in sorry guise, through the narrow hole.
      It was a pitiful exhibition. Were it not for the danger and uncertainty of
      the event, they could almost themselves have fairly laughed at it. King
      Khatsua stood before them, a tall, full-blooded black, in European
      costume, with a round felt hat and a crimson tie, surrounded by his naked
      wives and attendants. In his outstretched hand he held before their faces
      two incriminating diamonds. He spoke to them with much dignity at
      considerable length in the Barolong tongue, to a running accompaniment of
      laudatory exclamations&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, my King! Oh, wise words!&rdquo;&mdash;from
      the mouths of his courtiers. Neither Granville nor Guy understood, of
      course, a single syllable of the stately address; but that didn&rsquo;t in
      the least disturb the composure of the dusky monarch. He went right
      through to the end with his solemn warning, scolding them both roundly, as
      they guessed, in his native tongue, like a master reproving a pair of
      naughty schoolboys.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he finished, their captor stood forth with great importance to act as
      interpreter. He had been to the Kimberly diamond mines himself as a
      labourer, and was therefore accounted by his own people a perfect model of
      English scholarship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King Khatsua say this,&rdquo; he observed curtly. &ldquo;You very
      bad men; you come to Barolong land. King Khatsua say, Barolong land for
      Barolong. No allow white man dig here for diamonds. If white man come, him
      eat up Barolong. Keep white man out; keep land for King Khatsua.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does King Khatsua want us to leave his country, then?&rdquo;
      Granville Kelmscott asked, with a distinct tremor in his voice, for the
      great chief and his followers looked decidedly hostile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interpreter threw back his head and laughed a loud long laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King Khatsua not a fool!&rdquo; he answered at last, after a
      rhetorical pause. &ldquo;King Khatsua no want to give up his land to white
      man. If you two white man go back to Kimberley, you tell plenty other
      people, &lsquo;Diamonds in Barolong land.&rsquo; You say, &lsquo;Come
      along o&rsquo; me to Barolong land with gun; we show you where to dig
      &lsquo;um!&rsquo; No, no, King Khatsua not a fool. King Khatsua say this.
      You two white man no go back to Kimberley. You spies. You stop here plenty
      time along o&rsquo; King Khatsua. Never go back, till King Khatsua give
      leave. So no let any other white man come along into Barolong land.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville looked at Guy, and Guy looked at Granville. In this last
      extremity, before those domineering blacks, they almost forgot everything,
      save that they were both English. What were they to do now? The situation
      was becoming truly terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interpreter went on once more, however, with genuine savage enjoyment
      of the consternation he was causing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;King Khatsua say this,&rdquo; he continued, in a very amused tone.
      &ldquo;You stop here plenty days, very good, in Barolong land. King
      Khatsua give you hut; King Khatsua give you claim; Barolong man bring
      spear and guard you. No do you any harm for fear of Governor. Governor
      keep plenty guns in Cape Town. You two white man live in hut together, dig
      diamonds together; get plenty pebbles. Keep one diamond you find for
      yourself; give one diamond after that to King Khatsua. Barolong man bring
      you plenty food, plenty drink, but no let you go back. You try to go, then
      Barolong man spear you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The playful dig with which the savage thrust forward his assegai at that
      final remark showed Granville Kelmscott in a moment this was no idle
      threat. It was clear for the present they must accept the inevitable. They
      must remain in Barolong land; and he must share hut and work with that
      doubly hateful creature&mdash;the man who had deprived him of his
      patrimony at Tilgate, and whom he firmly believed to be the murderer of
      Montague Nevitt. This was what had come then of his journey to Africa!
      Truly, adversity makes us acquainted with strange bedfellows!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. &mdash; TIME FLIES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Eighteen months passed away in England, and nothing more was heard of the
      two fugitives to Africa. Lady Emily&rsquo;s cup was very full indeed. On
      the self-same day she learned of her husband&rsquo;s death and her son&rsquo;s
      mysterious and unaccountable disappearance. From that moment forth, he was
      to her as if dead. After Granville left, no letter or news of him, direct
      or indirect, ever reached Tilgate. It was all most inexplicable. He had
      disappeared into space, and no man knew of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril, too, had now almost given up hoping for news of Guy. Slowly the
      conviction forced itself deeper and still deeper upon his mind, in spite
      of Elma, that Guy was really Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s murderer. Else how
      account for Guy&rsquo;s sudden disappearance, and for the fact that he
      never even wrote home his whereabouts? Nay, Guy&rsquo;s letter itself left
      no doubt upon his mind. Cyril went through life now oppressed continually
      with the terrible burden of being a murderer&rsquo;s brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed everybody else&mdash;except Elma Clifford&mdash;implicitly
      shared that opinion with him. Cyril was sure the unknown benefactor shared
      it too, for Guy&rsquo;s six thousand pounds were never paid in to his
      credit&mdash;as indeed how could they, since Colonel Kelmscott, who had
      promised to pay them, died before receiving the balance of the purchase
      money for the Dowlands estate? Cyril slank through the world, then,
      weighed down by his shame, for Guy and he were each other&rsquo;s doubles,
      and he always had a deep underlying conviction that, as Guy was in any
      particular, so also in the very fibre of his nature he himself was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody else, except Elma Clifford; but in spite of all, Elma still held
      out firm, in her intuitive way, in favour of Guy&rsquo;s innocence. She
      knew it, she said; and there the matter dropped. And she knew quite
      equally, in her own firm mind, that Gilbert Gildersleeve was the real
      murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert Gildersleeve, meanwhile, had gone up a step or two higher in the
      social scale. He had been promoted to the bench on the first vacancy, as
      all the world had long expected; but, strange to say, he took it far more
      modestly than all the world had ever anticipated. Indeed, before he was
      made a judge, everybody said he&rsquo;d be intolerable in the ermine. He
      was blustering and bullying enough, in all conscience, as a mere Queen&rsquo;s
      Counsel; but when he came to preside in a court of his own, his insolence
      would surpass even the wonted insolence of our autocratic British
      justices. In this, however, everybody was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious change had of late come over Gilbert Gildersleeve. The big,
      bullying lawyer was growing nervous and diffident, where of old he had
      been coarse and self-assertive and blustering. He was beginning at times
      almost to doubt his own absolute omniscience and absolute wisdom. He was
      prepared half to admit that under certain circumstances a prisoner might
      possibly be in the right, and that all crimes alike did not necessarily
      deserve the hardest sentence the law of the land allowed him to allot
      them. Habitual criminals even began, after a while, to express a fervent
      hope, as assizes approached, they might be tried by old Gildersleeve:
      &ldquo;Gilly,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;gave a cove a chance&rdquo;: he
      wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;one of these &lsquo;ere reg&rsquo;lar ‘anging judges,
      like Sir &lsquo;Enery Atkins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During those eighteen months, too, Cyril tried, as far as he could, from a
      stern sense of duty, to see as little as possible of Elma Clifford. He
      loved Elma still&mdash;that goes without saying&mdash;more devotedly than
      ever; and Elma&rsquo;s profound belief that Cyril&rsquo;s brother couldn&rsquo;t
      possibly have committed so grave a crime touched his heart to the core by
      its womanly confidence. There&rsquo;s nothing a man likes so much as being
      trusted. But he had declared in the first flush of his horror and despair
      that he would never again ask Elma to marry him till the cloud that hung
      over Guy&rsquo;s character had been lifted and dissipated; and now that,
      month after month, no news came from Guy and all hope seemed to fade, lie
      felt it would be wrong of him even to see her or speak with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that question however, Elma herself had a voice as well. Man proposes;
      woman decides. And though Elma for her part had quite equally made up her
      mind never to marry Cyril, with that nameless terror of expected madness
      hanging ever over her head, she felt, on the other hand, her very loyalty
      to Cyril and to Cyril&rsquo;s brother imperatively demanded that she
      should still see him often, and display marked friendship towards him as
      openly as possible. She wanted the world to see plainly for itself that so
      far as this matter of Guy&rsquo;s reputation was concerned, if Cyril, for
      his part, wanted to marry her, she, on her side, would be quite ready to
      marry Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she insisted on meeting him whenever she could, and on writing to him
      openly from time to time very affectionate notes&mdash;those familiar
      notes we all know so well and prize so dearly&mdash;full of hopeless love
      and unabated confidence. Yes, good Mr. Stockbroker who do me the honour to
      read my simple tale, smile cynically if you will! You pretend to care
      nothing for these little sentimentalities; but you know very well in your
      own heart, you&rsquo;ve a bundle of them at home, very brown and yellow,
      locked up in your escritoire; and you&rsquo;d let New Zealand Fours sink
      to the bottom of the Indian Ocean, and Egyptian Unified go down to zero,
      before ever you&rsquo;d part with a single faded page of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      What can a man do, then, even under such painful circumstances, when a
      girl whom he loves with all his heart lets him clearly see she loves him
      in return quite as truly? Cyril would have been more than human if he hadn&rsquo;t
      answered those notes in an equally ardent and equally desponding strain.
      The burden of both their tales was always this&mdash;even if YOU would, <i>I</i>
      couldn&rsquo;t, because I love you too much to impose my own disgrace upon
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what Elma&rsquo;s mysterious trouble could be, Cyril was still unable
      even to hazard a guess. He only knew she had some reason of her own which
      seemed to her a sufficient bar to matrimony, and made her firmly determine
      never, in any case, to marry any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      About twelve months after Guy&rsquo;s sudden disappearance, however, a new
      element entered into Elma&rsquo;s life. At first sight, it seemed to have
      but little to do with the secret of her soul. It was merely that the new
      purchaser of the Dowlands estate had built herself a pretty little Queen
      Anne house on the ground, and come to live in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, from the very first day they met, Elma took most kindly to
      this new Miss Ewes, the strange and eccentric musical composer. The
      mistress of Dowlands was a distant cousin of Mrs. Clifford&rsquo;s own; so
      the family naturally had to call upon her at once; and Elma somehow seemed
      always to get on from the outset in a remarkable way with her mother&rsquo;s
      relations. At first, to be sure, Elma could see Mrs. Clifford was rather
      afraid to leave her alone with the odd new-comer, whose habits and manners
      were as curious and weird as the sudden twists and turns of her own
      wayward music. But, after a time, a change came over Mrs. Clifford in this
      respect; and instead of trying to keep Elma and Miss Ewes apart, it was
      evident to Elma&mdash;who never missed any of the small by-play of life&mdash;that
      her mother rather desired to throw them closely together. Thus it came to
      pass that one morning, about a month after Miss Ewes&rsquo;s arrival in
      her new home, Elma had run in with a message from her mother, and found
      the distinguished composer, as was often the case at that time of day,
      sitting dreamily at her piano, trying over on the gamut strange, fanciful
      chords of her own peculiar witch-like character. The music waxed and waned
      in a familiar lilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; Elma cried enthusiastically, as the
      composer looked up at her with an inquiring glance. &ldquo;I never heard
      anything in my life before that went so straight through one, with its
      penetrating melody. Such a lovely gliding sound, you know! So soft and
      serpentine!&rdquo; And even as she said it, a deep flush rose red in the
      centre of her cheek. She was sorry for the words before they were out of
      her mouth. They recalled all at once, in some mysterious way, that horrid,
      persistent nightmare of the hateful snake-dance. In a second, Miss Ewes
      caught the bright gleam in her eye, and the deep flush on her cheek that
      so hastily followed it. A meaning smile came over the elder woman&rsquo;s
      face all at once, not unpleasantly. She was a handsome woman for her age,
      but very dark and gipsy-like, after the fashion of the Eweses, with keen
      Italian eyes and a large smooth expanse of powerful forehead. Lightly she
      ran her hand over the keys with a masterly touch, and fixed her glance as
      she did so on Elma. There was a moment&rsquo;s pause. Miss Ewes eyed her
      closely. She was playing a tune that seemed oddly familiar to Elma&rsquo;s
      brain somehow&mdash;to her brain, not to her ears, for Elma felt certain,
      even while she recognised it most, she had never before heard it. It was a
      tune that waxed and waned and curled up and down sinuously, and twisted in
      and out and&mdash;ah yes, now she knew it&mdash;raised its sleek head, and
      darted out its forked tongue, and vibrated with swift tremors, and
      tightened and slackened, and coiled resistlessly at last in great folds
      all around her. Elma listened, with eager eyes half starting from her
      head, with clenched nails dug deep into the tremulous palms, as her heart
      throbbed fast and her nerves quivered fiercely. Oh, it was wrong of Miss
      Ewes to tempt her like this! It was wrong, so wrong of her! For Elma knew
      what it was at once&mdash;the song she had heard running vaguely through
      her head the night of the dance&mdash;the night she fell in love with
      Cyril Waring.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a throbbing heart, Elma sat down on the sofa, and tried with all her
      might and main not to listen, She clasped her hands still tighter. She
      refused to be wrought up. She wouldn&rsquo;t give way to it. If she had
      followed her own impulse, to be sure, she would have risen on the spot and
      danced that mad dance once more with all the wild abandonment of an almeh
      or a Zingari. But she resisted with all her might. And she resisted
      successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ewes, never faltering, kept her keen eye fixed hard on her with a
      searching glance, as she ran over the keys in ever fresh combinations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faster, wilder, and stranger the music rose; but Elma sat still, her
      breast heaving hard, and her breath panting, yet otherwise as still and
      motionless as a statue. She knew Miss Ewes could tell exactly how she
      felt. She knew she was trying her; she knew she was tempting her to get up
      and dance; and yet, she was not one bit afraid of this strange weird
      woman, as she&rsquo;d been afraid that sad morning at home of her own
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The composer went on fiercely for some minutes more, leaning close over
      the keyboard, and throwing her very soul, as Elma could plainly see, into
      the tips of her fingers. Then, suddenly she rose, and came over, well
      pleased, to the sofa where Elma sat. With a motherly gesture, she took
      Elma&rsquo;s hand; she smoothed her dark hair; she bent down with a tender
      look, in those strange grey eyes, and printed a kiss unexpectedly on the
      poor girl&rsquo;s forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elma,&rdquo; she said, leaning over her, &ldquo;do you know what
      that was? That was the Naga Snake Dance. It gave you an almost
      irresistible longing to rise, and hold the snake in your own hands, and
      coil his great folds around you. I could see how you felt. But you were
      strong enough to resist. That was very well done. You resisted even the
      force of my music, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma, trembling all over, but bursting with joy that she could speak of it
      at last without restraint to somebody, answered, in a very low and
      tremulous voice, &ldquo;Yes, Miss Ewes, I resisted it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Ewes leant back in her place, and gazed at her long, with a very
      affectionate and motherly air. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
      know,&rdquo; she said at last, breaking out in a voice full of confidence,
      &ldquo;why on earth you shouldn&rsquo;t marry this young man you&rsquo;re
      in love with!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma&rsquo;s heart beat still harder and higher than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What young man?&rdquo; she murmured low&mdash;just to test the
      enchantress.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Miss Ewes made answer, without one moment&rsquo;s hesitation, &ldquo;Why,
      of course, Cyril Waring!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or two then, there was a dead silence. After that, Miss Ewes
      looked up and spoke again. &ldquo;Have you felt it often?&rdquo; she
      asked, without one word of explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice before,&rdquo; Elma answered, not pretending to
      misunderstand. &ldquo;Once I gave way. That was the very first time, you
      see, and I didn&rsquo;t know yet exactly what it meant. The second time I
      knew, and then I resisted it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, before Miss Ewes, she hardly ever felt shy. She was so conscious
      Miss Ewes knew all about it without her telling her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder woman looked at her with unfeigned admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was brave of you,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
      have done it myself! I should have HAD to give way to it. Then in YOU it&rsquo;s
      dying out. That&rsquo;s as clear as daylight. It won&rsquo;t go any
      farther. I knew it wouldn&rsquo;t, of course, when I saw you resisted even
      the Naga dance. And for you, that&rsquo;s excellent.... For myself I
      encourage it. It&rsquo;s that that makes my music what it is. It&rsquo;s
      that that inspires me. <i>I</i> composed that Naga dance I just played
      over to you, Elma. But not all out of my own head. I couldn&rsquo;t have
      invented it. It comes down in our blood, my dear, to you and me alike. We
      both inherit it from a common ancestress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all about it,&rdquo; Elma cried, nestling close to her new
      friend with a wild burst of relief. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why, but I&rsquo;m
      not at all ashamed of it all before you, Miss Ewes&mdash;at least, not in
      the way I am before mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be ashamed of it,&rdquo; Miss Ewes answered
      kindly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve nothing to be ashamed of. It&rsquo;ll never
      trouble YOU in your life again. It always dies out at last; they say in
      the sixth or seventh generation, and when it&rsquo;s dying out, it goes as
      it went with you, on the night you first fell in love with Cyril. If,
      after that, you resist, it never comes back again. Year after year, the
      impulse grows feebler and feebler. And if you can withstand the Naga
      dance, you can withstand anything. Come here and take my hand, dear. I&rsquo;ll
      tell you all about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Late at night Elma sat, tearful but happy, in her own room at home,
      writing a few short lines to Cyril Waring. This was all she said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason on my side now, dearest Cyril. It&rsquo;s
      all a mistake. I&rsquo;ll marry you whenever and wherever you will. There
      need be no reason on your side either. I love you, and can trust you.
      Yours ever,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;ELMA.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Cyril Waring received that note next morning he kissed it reverently,
      and put it away in his desk among a bundle of others. But he said to
      himself sternly in his own soul for all that, &ldquo;Never, while Guy
      still rests under that cloud! And how it&rsquo;s ever to be lifted from
      him is to me inconceivable.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXIV. &mdash; A STROKE FOR FREEDOM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Africa, meanwhile, during those eighteen months, King Khatsua had kept
      his royal word. He had held his two European prisoners under close watch
      and ward in the Koranna hut he had assigned them for their residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most other negro princes, indeed, Khatsua was a shrewd man of
      business in his own way; and while he meant to prevent the English
      strangers from escaping seaward with news of the new El Dorado they had
      discovered in Barolong land, he hadn&rsquo;t the least idea of turning
      away on that account the incidental advantages to be gained for himself by
      permitting them to hunt freely in his dominions for diamonds. So long as
      they acquiesced in the rough-and-ready royalty of 50 per cent, he had
      proposed to them when he first decided to detain them in his own territory&mdash;one
      stone for the king, and one for the explorers&mdash;they were free to
      pursue their quest after gems to their hearts&rsquo; content in the
      valleys of Barolong land. And as the two Englishmen, for their part, had
      nothing else to do in Africa, and as they still went on hoping against
      hope for some chance of escape or rescue, they dug for diamonds with a
      will, and secured a number of first-class stones that would have made
      their fortunes indeed&mdash;if only they could have got them to the sea or
      to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course they lived perforce in the Koranna hut assigned them by the
      king, in pretty much the same way as the Korannas themselves did. King
      Khatsua&rsquo;s men supplied them abundantly with grain, and fruits, and
      game; and even at times procured them ready-made clothes, by exchange with
      Kimberley. In other respects, they were not ill-treated; they were merely
      detained &ldquo;during his majesty&rsquo;s pleasure.&rdquo; But as his
      majesty had no intention of killing the goose that laid the golden eggs,
      or of letting them go, if he could help it, to spread the news of their
      find among their greedy fellow-countrymen, it seemed to them both as if
      they might go on being detained like this in Barolong land for an
      indefinite period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, things went indifferently with them. As they lived and worked
      together in their native hut by Khatsua&rsquo;s village, a change began
      slowly but irresistibly to come over Granville Kelmscott&rsquo;s feelings
      towards his unacknowledged half-brother. At first, it was with the deepest
      sense of distaste and loathing that the dispossessed heir found himself
      compelled to associate with Guy Waring in such close companionship. But,
      bit by bit, as they two saw more and more of one another, this feeling of
      distaste began to wear off piecemeal. Granville Kelmscott was more than
      half ashamed to admit it even to himself, but in process of time he really
      almost caught himself beginning to like&mdash;well, to like the man he
      believed to be a murderer. It was shocking and horrible, no doubt; but
      what else was he to do? Guy formed now his only European society. By the
      side of those savage Barolongs, whose chief thought nothing of
      perpetrating the most nameless horrors before their very eyes, for the
      gratification of mere freaks of passion or jealousy, a European murderer
      of the gentlemanly class seemed almost by comparison a mild and gentle
      personage. Granville hardly liked to allow it in his own mind, but it was
      nevertheless the case; he was getting positively fond of this man, Guy
      Waring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, blood is generally thicker than water. Living in such close daily
      communion with Guy, and talking with him unrestrainedly at last upon all
      possible points&mdash;save that one unapproachable one, which both seemed
      to instinctively avoid alluding to in any way&mdash;Granville began to
      feel that, murderer or no murderer, Guy was in all essentials very near
      indeed to him. Nay, more, he found himself at times actually arguing the
      point with his own conscience that, after all, Guy was a very good sort of
      fellow; and if ever he had murdered Montague Nevitt at all&mdash;which
      looked very probable&mdash;he must have murdered him under considerably
      extenuating circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one thing about Guy that Granville didn&rsquo;t like when
      he got to know him. This homicidal half-brother of his was gentle as a
      woman; tender, kindhearted, truthful, affectionate; a gentleman to the
      core, and a jolly good fellow into the bargain; but&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      always a but&mdash;he was a terrible money-grubber! Even there in the lost
      heart of Africa, at such a distance from home, with so little chance of
      ever making any use of his hoarded wealth, the fellow used to hunt up
      those wretched small stones, and wear them night and day in a belt round
      his waist, as if he really loved them for their own mere sakes&mdash;dirty
      high-priced little baubles! Granville, for his part, couldn&rsquo;t bear
      to see such ingrained love of pelf. It was miserable; it was mercenary.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, he himself hunted diamonds every day of his life, just as hard
      as Guy did; there was nothing else to do in this detestable place, and a
      man MUST find something to turn his idle hands to. Also he carried them,
      like Guy, bound up in a girdle round his own waist; it was a pity they
      should be lost, if ever he should chance to get away safe in the end to
      England. But then, don&rsquo;t you see, the cases were so different. Guy
      hoarded up his diamonds for mere wretched gain; whereas Granville valued
      his (he said to himself often) not for the mere worth in money of those
      shimmering little trinkets, but for his mother&rsquo;s sake, and
      Gwendoline&rsquo;s, and the credit of the family. He wanted Lady Emily to
      see her son filling the place in the world she had always looked forward
      with hope to his filling; and, by Heaven&rsquo;s help, he thought, he
      could still fill it. He couldn&rsquo;t marry Gwendoline on a beggar&rsquo;s
      pittance; and, by Heaven&rsquo;s help, he hoped still to be able to marry
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy, on the other hand, found himself almost equally surprised in turn at
      the rapid way he grew really to be fond of Granville Kelmscott. Though
      Kelmscott knew, as he thought, the terrible secret of his half-unconscious
      crime&mdash;for he could feel now how completely he had acted under
      Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s compelling influence&mdash;Guy was aware before
      long of such a profound and deep-seated sympathy existing between them,
      that he became exceedingly attached in time to his friendly
      fellow-prisoner. In spite of the one barrier they could never break down,
      he spoke freely by degrees to Granville of everything else in his whole
      life; and Granville in return spoke to him just as freely. A good fellow,
      Granville, when you got to know him. There was only a single trait in his
      character Guy couldn&rsquo;t endure; and that was his ingrained love of
      money-grubbing. For the way the man pounced down upon those dirty little
      stones, when he saw them in the mud, and hoarded them up in his belt, and
      seemed prepared to defend them with his very life-blood, Guy couldn&rsquo;t
      conceal from himself-the fact that he fairly despised him. Such vulgar,
      common-place, unredeemed love of pelf! Such mere bourgeois avarice! Of
      what use could those wretched pebbles be to him here in the dusty plains
      of far inland Africa?
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy himself kept close count of his finds, to be sure; but then, the
      cases, don&rsquo;t you see, were so different! HE wanted his diamonds to
      discharge the great debt of his life to Cyril, and to appear an honest
      man, rehabilitated once more, before the brother he had so deeply wronged
      and humiliated. Whereas Granville Kelmscott, a rich man&rsquo;s son, and
      the heir to a great estate beyond the dreams of avarice&mdash;that HE
      should have come risking his life in these savage wilds for mere increase
      of superfluous wealth, why, it was simply despicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      So eighteen months wore away, in mutual friendship, tempered to a certain
      degree by mutual contempt, and little chance of escape came to the
      captives in Barolong land.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, as the second winter came round once more, for two or three weeks
      the Englishmen in their huts began to perceive that much bustle and
      confusion was going on all around in King Khatsua&rsquo;s dominions.
      Preparations for a war on a considerable scale were clearly taking place.
      Men mustered daily on the dusty plain with firearms and assegais. Much
      pombè was drunk; many palavers took place; a constant drumming of gongs
      and tom-toms disturbed their ears by day and by night. The Englishmen
      concluded some big marauding expedition was in contemplation. And they
      were quite right. King Khatsua was about to concentrate his forces for an
      attack on a neighbouring black monarch, as powerful and perhaps as cruel
      as himself, Montisive of the Bush Veldt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the preparations went on all around. Then the great day came at
      last, and King Khatsua set forth on his mighty campaign, to the sound of
      big drums and the blare of native trumpets.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the warriors had marched out of the villages on their way northward
      to the war, Guy saw the two prisoners&rsquo; chance of escape had arrived
      in earnest. They were guarded as usual, of course; but not so strictly as
      before; and during the night, in particular, Guy noticed with pleasure,
      little watch was now kept upon them. The savage, indeed, can&rsquo;t hold
      two ideas in his head at once. If he&rsquo;s making war on his neighbour
      on one side, he has no room left to think of guarding his prisoners on the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; Guy said, one evening, as they sat together in
      their hut, over their native supper of mealie cakes and springbok venison,
      &ldquo;we must make a bold stroke. We must creep out of the kraal as well
      as we can, and go for the sea westward, through Namaqua land to Angra
      Pequena.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Westward?&rdquo; Granville answered, very dubiously. &ldquo;But why
      westward, Waring? Surely our shortest way to the coast is down to
      Kimberley and so on to the Cape. It&rsquo;ll take us weeks and weeks to
      reach the sea, won&rsquo;t it, by way of Namaqua land?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter for that,&rdquo; Guy replied, with confidence. He knew
      the map pretty well, and had thought it all over. &ldquo;As soon as the
      Barolong miss us in the morning, they&rsquo;ll naturally think we&rsquo;ve
      gone south, as you say, towards our own people. So they&rsquo;ll pursue us
      in that direction and try to take us; and if they were to catch us after
      we&rsquo;d once run away, you may be sure they&rsquo;d kill us as soon as
      look at us. But it would never occur to them, don&rsquo;t you see, we were
      going away west. They won&rsquo;t follow us that way. So west we&rsquo;ll
      go, and strike out for the sea, as I say, at Angra Pequena.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat up through the night discussing plans low to themselves in the
      dark, till nearly two in the morning. Then, when all was silent around,
      and the Barolong slept, they stole quietly out, and began their long march
      across the country to westward. Each man had his diamonds tied tightly
      round his waist, and his revolver at his belt. They were prepared to face
      every unknown danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crawling past the native huts with very cautious steps, they made for the
      open, and emerged from the village on to the heights that bounded the
      valley of the Lugura. They had proceeded in this direction for more than
      an hour, walking as hard as their legs would carry them, when the sound of
      a man running fast, but barefoot, fell on their ears from behind in a
      regular pit-a-pat. Guy looked back in dismay, and saw a naked Barolong
      just silhouetted against the pale sky on the top of a long low ridge they
      had lately crossed over. At the very same instant Granville raised his
      revolver and pointed it at the man, who evidently had not yet perceived
      them. With a sudden gesture of horror, Guy knocked down his hand and
      prevented his taking aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot,&rdquo; he cried, in a voice of surprised dismay
      and disapproval. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t take his life. How do we know he&rsquo;s
      an enemy at all? He mayn&rsquo;t be pursuing us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best shoot on spec, anyway,&rdquo; Granville answered, somewhat
      discomposed. &ldquo;All&rsquo;s fair in war. The fellow&rsquo;s after us
      no doubt. And, at any rate, if he sees us he may go and report our
      whereabouts to the village.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? shoot an unarmed man who shows no signs of hostility! Why, it
      would be sheer murder,&rdquo; Guy cried, with some horror. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t
      make our retreat on THOSE principles, Kelmscott; it&rsquo;d be quite
      indefensible. I decline to fire except when we&rsquo;re attacked. I won&rsquo;t
      be any party, myself, to needless bloodshed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville Kelmscott gazed at him, there in the grey dawn, in unspeakable
      surprise. Not shoot at a negro! In such straits, too, as theirs! And this
      rebuke had come to him&mdash;from the mouth of the murderer!
    </p>
    <p>
      Turn it over as he might, Granville couldn&rsquo;t understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Barolong ran along on the crest of the ridge, still at the top of his
      speed, without seeming to notice them in the gloom of the valley.
      Presently, he disappeared over the edge to southward. Guy was right, after
      all. He wasn&rsquo;t in pursuit of them. More likely he was only a runaway
      slave, taking advantage, like themselves, of King Khatsua&rsquo;s absence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. &mdash; PERILS BY THE WAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three weeks later, two torn and tattered, half-starved Europeans sat under
      a burning South African sun by the dry bed of a shrunken summer torrent.
      It was in the depths of Namaqua land, among the stony Karoo; and the
      fugitives were straggling, helplessly and hopelessly, seaward, thirsty and
      weary, through a half-hostile country, making their marches as best they
      could at dead of night and resting by day where the natives would permit
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their commissariat had indeed been a lean and hungry one. Though they
      carried many thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of diamonds about their persons,
      they had nothing negotiable with which to buy food or shelter from the
      uncivilized Namaquas. Ivory, cloth, and beads were the currency of the
      country. No native thereabouts would look for a moment at their little
      round nobs of water-worn pebbles. The fame of the diamond fields hadn&rsquo;t
      penetrated as yet so far west in the land as to have reached to the huts
      of the savage Namaquas.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now their staying power was almost worn out Granville Kelmscott lay
      down on the sandy soil with a wild gesture of despair. All around were
      bare rocks and the dry sweltering veldts, covered only with round stones
      and red sand and low bushy vegetation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waring,&rdquo; he said feebly, in a very faint voice, &ldquo;I wish
      you&rsquo;d leave me and go on by yourself. I&rsquo;m no good any more. I&rsquo;m
      only a drag upon you. This fever&rsquo;s too bad for me to stand much
      longer. I can never pull through to the coast alive. I&rsquo;ve no energy
      left, were it even to try. I&rsquo;d like to lie down here and die where I
      sit. Do go and leave me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; Guy answered resolutely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never
      desert you, Kelmscott, while I&rsquo;ve a drop of blood left. If I carry
      you on my back to the coast, I&rsquo;ll get you there at last, or else we&rsquo;ll
      both die on the veldt together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville held his friend&rsquo;s hand in his own fevered fingers as he
      might have held a woman&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Waring,&rdquo; he cried once more, in a voice half choked with
      profound emotion, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you enough for
      all you&rsquo;ve done for me. You&rsquo;ve behaved to me like a brother&mdash;like
      a brother indeed. It makes me ashamed to think, when I see how unselfish,
      and good, and kind you&rsquo;ve been&mdash;ashamed to think I once
      distrusted you. You&rsquo;ve been an angel to me all through. Without you,
      I don&rsquo;t know how I could ever have lived on through this journey at
      all. And I can&rsquo;t bear to feel now I may spoil your retreat&mdash;can&rsquo;t
      bear to know I&rsquo;m a drag and burden to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; Guy said, holding the thin and fevered hand
      very tenderly in his, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk to me like that. I feel to
      you every bit as you feel to me in this matter. I was afraid of you at
      first, because I knew you misunderstood me. But the more I&rsquo;ve seen
      of you, the better we&rsquo;ve each of us learned to sympathize with the
      other. We&rsquo;ve long been friends. I love you now, as you say, like a
      brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville hesitated for a moment. Should he out with it or not? Then at
      last the whole long-suppressed truth came out with a burst. He seized his
      companion&rsquo;s two hands at once in a convulsive grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not surprising either,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;after
      all&mdash;for Guy, do you know, we ARE really brothers!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy gazed at him in astonishment. For a moment he thought his friend&rsquo;s
      reason was giving way. Then slowly and gradually he took it all in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ARE really brothers!&rdquo; he repeated, in a dazed sort of way.
      &ldquo;Do you mean it, Kelmscott? Then my father and Cyril&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was mine too, Waring. Yes; I couldn&rsquo;t bear to die without
      telling you that. And I tell it now to you. You two are the heirs of the
      Tilgate estates. And the unknown person who paid six thousand pounds to
      Cyril, just before you left England, was your father and mine&mdash;Colonel
      Henry Kelmscott.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy bent over him for a few seconds in speechless surprise. Words failed
      him at first. &ldquo;How do you know all this, Kelmscott?&rdquo; he said
      at last faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville told him in as few words as possible&mdash;for indeed he was
      desperately weak and ill&mdash;by what accident he had discovered his
      father&rsquo;s secret. But he told him only what he knew himself. For, of
      course, he was ignorant as yet of the Colonel&rsquo;s seizure and sudden
      death on the very day after they had sailed from England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy listened to it all in profound silence. It was a strange, and for him
      a momentous tale. Then he said at last, as Granville finished, &ldquo;And
      you never told me this all these long months, Kelmscott.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always meant to tell you, Guy,&rdquo; his half-brother answered,
      in a sudden fit of penitence. &ldquo;I always meant in the end you and
      your brother Cyril should come into your own at Tilgate as you ought. I
      was only waiting&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till you&rsquo;d realized enough to make good some part of your
      personal loss,&rdquo; Guy suggested, not unkindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Granville answered, flushing up at the suggestion.
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t waiting for that. Don&rsquo;t think me so mercenary.
      I was waiting for YOU, in your turn to extend to ME your own personal
      confidence. You know, Guy,&rdquo; he went on, dropping into a still more
      hushed and solemn undertone, &ldquo;I saw an evening paper the night we
      left Plymouth&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know, I know,&rdquo; Guy cried, interrupting him, with a very
      pale face. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me of that. I can&rsquo;t bear to
      think of it. Kelmscott, I was mad when I did that deed. I wasn&rsquo;t
      myself. I acted under somebody else&rsquo;s compulsion and influence. The
      man had a sort of hypnotic power over my will, I believe. I couldn&rsquo;t
      help doing whatever he ordered me. It was he who suggested it. It was he
      that did it. And it&rsquo;s he who was really and truly guilty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who was that man?&rdquo; Granville Kelmscott asked with some
      little curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason I shouldn&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; Guy
      answered, &ldquo;now we&rsquo;ve once broken the ice; and I&rsquo;m glad
      in my heart, I must say, that we&rsquo;ve broken it. For a year and a
      half, day and night, that barrier has been raised between us always, and I&rsquo;ve
      longed to get rid of it. But I was afraid to speak of it to you, and you
      to me! Well, the man, if you must know, was Montague Nevitt!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville Kelmscott looked up at him in credulous surprise. But he was too
      ill and weak to ask the meaning of this riddle. Montague Nevitt! What on
      earth could Waring mean by that? How on earth could Montague Nevitt have
      influenced and directed him in assaulting and murdering Montague Nevitt?
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time there was silence. Each brother was thinking his own
      thoughts to himself about this double disclosure. At last, Granville
      lifted his head and spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll go home to England now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;under
      an assumed name, I suppose; and arrange with your brother Cyril for him to
      claim the Kelmscott estates, and allow you something out of them in
      retirement somewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Guy answered manfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home to
      England now, if I go at all, under my own proper name that I&rsquo;ve
      always borne, to repay Cyril in full every penny I owe him, to make what
      reparation I can for the wrong I&rsquo;ve done, and to give myself up to
      the police for trial.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville gazed at him, more surprised and more admiring than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brave man, Waring,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t understand it at all. But I know you&rsquo;re right. And I
      almost believe you. I almost believe it was not your fault. I should like
      to get through to England after all, if it was only to see you safe out of
      your troubles.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy looked at him fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; he said, in a compassionate tone, &ldquo;you
      mustn&rsquo;t talk any more. You&rsquo;ve talked a great deal too much
      already. I see a hut, I fancy, over yonder, beside that dark patch of
      brush. Now, you must do exactly as I bid you. Don&rsquo;t struggle or
      kick. Lie as still as you can. I&rsquo;ll carry you there on my back, and
      then we&rsquo;ll see if we can get you anyhow a drop of pure water.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. &mdash; DESERTED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That was almost the last thing Granville Kelmscott knew. Some strange
      shadowy dreams, to be sure, disturbed the lethargy into which he fell soon
      after; but they were intermittent and indefinite. He was vaguely aware of
      being lifted with gentle care into somebody&rsquo;s arms, and of the
      somebody staggering along with him, not without considerable difficulty,
      over the rough stony ground of that South African plateau. He remembered
      also, as in a trance, some sound of angry voices&mdash;a loud
      expostulation&mdash;a hasty palaver&mdash;a long slow pause&mdash;a
      gradual sense of reconciliation and friendliness&mdash;during all which,
      as far as he could recover the circumstances afterwards, he must have been
      extended on the earth, with his back propped against a great ledge of
      jutting rock, and his head hanging listless on his sinking breast.
      Thenceforward all was blank, or just dimly perceived at long intervals
      between delirium and unconsciousness. He was ill for many days, where or
      how he knew not.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some half dreamy way, he was aware too, now and again, of strange
      voices by his side, strange faces tending him. But they were black faces,
      all, and the voices spoke in deep guttural tones, unlike even the clicks
      and harsh Bantu jerks with which he had grown so familiar in eighteen
      months among the Barolong. This that he heard now, or seemed to hear in
      his delirium, like distant sounds of water, was a wholly different and
      very much harsher tongue&mdash;the tongue of the Namaquas, in fact, though
      Granville was far too ill and too drowsy just then to think of reasoning
      about it or classifying it in any way. All he knew for the moment was that
      sometimes, when he turned round feebly on his bed of straw, and asked for
      drink or help in a faltering voice, no white man appeared to answer his
      summons. Black, faces all&mdash;black, black, and unfamiliar. Very
      intermittently he was conscious of a faint sense of loneliness. He knew
      not why. But he thought he could guess. Guy Waring had deserted him!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, one morning, after more days had passed than Granville could
      possibly count, all of a sudden, in a wild whirl, he came to himself again
      at once, with that instant revulsion of complete awakening which often
      occurs at the end of long fits of delirium in malarious fever. A light
      burst in upon him with a flash. In a moment, his brain seemed to clear all
      at once, and everything to grow plain as day before him. He raised himself
      on one wasted elbow and gazed around him with profound awe. He saw it all
      now; he remembered everything, everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was alone, among savages in the far heart of Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay on his back, on a heap of fresh straw, in a close and filthy
      mud-built hut. Under his aching neck a wooden pillow or prop of native
      make supported his head. Two women and a man bent over him and smiled.
      Their faces, though black, were far from unkindly. They were pleased to
      see him stare about with such meaning in his eyes. They were friendly, no
      doubt. They seemed really to take an interest in their patient&rsquo;s
      recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where was Guy Waring? Dead? Dead? Or run away? Had his half-brother,
      in this utmost need, then, so basely deserted him?
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes, Granville gazed around him, half dazed, and in a turmoil
      of surprise, yet with a vivid passion of acute inquiry. Now he was once
      well awake, he must know all immediately. But how? Who to ask? This was
      terrible, terrible. He had no means of intercommunication with the people
      in the hut. He knew none of their language, nor they of his. He was
      utterly alone, among unmitigated savages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the man and the women talked loud among themselves in their own
      harsh speech, evidently well pleased and satisfied at their guest&rsquo;s
      improvement. With a violent effort, Granville began to communicate with
      them in the language of signs which every savage knows as he knows his
      native tongue, and in which the two Englishmen had already made some
      progress during their stay in Barolong land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pointing first to himself, with one hand on his breast, he held up two
      fingers before the observant Namaqua, to indicate that at first there had
      been a couple of them on the road, both white men. The latter point he
      still further elaborated by showing the white skin on his own bare wrist,
      and once more holding up the two fingers demonstratively. The Namaqua
      nodded. He had seized the point well. He held up two fingers in return
      himself; then looked at his own black wrist and shook his head in dissent&mdash;they
      were not black men; after which he touched Granville&rsquo;s fair forearm
      with his hand; yes, yes, just so; he took it in; two white men.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had become of the other one? Granville asked in the same fashion, by
      looking around him on all sides in dumb show, inquiringly. One finger only
      was held up now, pointing about the hut; one hand was laid upon his own
      breast to show that a single white man alone remained. He glanced about
      him uneasily. What had happened to his companion?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Namaqua pointed with his finger to the door of the hut, as much as to
      say the other man was gone. He seized every sign at once with true savage
      quickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Granville tried once more. Was his companion dead? Had he been killed
      in a fight? Was that the reason of his absence? He lunged forward with his
      hand holding an imaginary assegai. He pressed on upon the foe; he drove it
      through a body. Then he fell, as if dead, on the floor, with a groan and a
      shriek. After which, picking himself up as well as he was able, and
      crawling back to his straw, he proceeded in mute pantomime to bury himself
      decently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Namaqua shook his head again with a laugh of dissent. Oh no; not like
      that. It had happened quite otherwise. The missing white man was well and
      vigorous, a slap on his own chest sufficiently indicated that news. He
      placed his two first fingers in the ground, astride like legs, and made
      them walk along fast, one in front of the other. The white man had gone
      away. He had gone on foot. Granville nodded acquiescence. The savage took
      water in a calabash and laid it on the floor. Then he walked once more
      with his fingers, as if on a long and weary march, to the water&rsquo;s
      brink. Granville nodded comprehension again. He understood the signs. The
      white man had gone away, alone, on foot&mdash;and seaward.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant, with a sudden cry of terror, the invalid&rsquo;s hands
      went down to his waist, where he wore the girdle that contained those
      precious diamonds&mdash;the diamonds that were to be the ransom of some
      fraction of Tilgate. An awful sense of desertion broke over him all at
      once. He called aloud in his horror. It was too much to believe. The
      girdle was gone, and the diamonds with it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hypocrite! Hypocrite! Thief! Murderer! Robber! He had trusted that vile
      creature, that plausible wretch, in spite of all the horrible charges he
      knew against him. And THIS was the sequel of their talk that day! THIS was
      how Guy Waring had requited his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stolen the fruits of eighteen months&rsquo; labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville turned to the Namaqua, wild with his terrible loss, and pointed
      angrily to his loins, where the diamonds were not. The savage nodded;
      looked wise and shook his head; pretended to gird himself round the waist
      with a cloth; then went over to Granville, who lay still in the straw,
      undid an imaginary belt, with deliberate care, tied it round his own body
      above the other one, with every appearance of prudence and forethought,
      counted the small stones in it one by one, in his hand, to the exact
      number, with grotesque fidelity, and finally set his fingers to walk a
      second time at a rapid pace, in the direction of the calabash which
      represented the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville fell back on his wooden pillow with a horrible groan of awakened
      distrust. The man had gone off, that was clear, and had stolen his
      diamonds That is what comes of intrusting your life and property to a
      discovered murderer. How could he ever have been such a fool? He would
      never forgive himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desertion itself was bad enough in all conscience; but it was as
      nothing at all in Granville&rsquo;s mind to the wickedness of the robbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have known it, of course. How that fellow toiled and moiled and
      gloated over his wretched diamonds! How little he seemed to think of the
      stain of blood on his hands, and how much of the mere chance of making
      filthy lucre! Pah! Pah! it was pitiable. The man&rsquo;s whole mind was
      distorted by a hideous fungoid growth&mdash;the love of gain, which is the
      root of all evil. For a few miserable stones, he would plunder his own
      brother, lying helpless and ill in that African hut, and make off with the
      booty himself, saving his own skin, seaward.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the unrequited kindness of these mere savage
      Namaquas, Granville cried to himself in his bitterness, he might have died
      of want in the open desert. And now he would go down to the coast, after
      all, a ruined man, penniless and friendless. It was a hard thought indeed
      for a Kelmscott to think he should have been abandoned and robbed by his
      own half-brother, and should owe his life now to a heathen African. The
      tender mercies of a naked barbarian in a mud-built hut were better than
      the false friendship of his father&rsquo;s son, the true heir of Tilgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was miserable! pitiable! The shock of that discovery threw Granville
      back once more into a profound fever. For several hours he relapsed into
      delirium. And the worst of it was, the negroes wouldn&rsquo;t let him die
      quietly in his own plain way. In the midst of it all, he was dimly aware
      of a dose thrust down his throat. It was the Namaqua administering him a
      pill&mdash;some nauseous native decoction, no doubt&mdash;which tasted as
      if it were made of stiff white paper.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. &mdash; AUX ARMES!
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a day or two more, Granville remained seriously ill in the dirty hut.
      At the end of that time, weak and wasted as he was, he insisted upon
      getting up and setting out alone on his long march seaward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wild resolve. He was utterly unfit for it. The hospitable
      Namaqua, whose wives had nursed him well through that almost hopeless
      illness, did his best to persuade the rash Englishman from so mad a
      course, by gestures and entreaties, in his own mute language. But
      Granville was obstinate. He would NOT sit down quietly and be robbed like
      this of the fruit of his labours. He would not be despoiled. He would not
      be trampled upon. He would make for the coast, if he staggered in like a
      skeleton, and would confront the robber with his own vile crime, be it at
      Angra Pequena, or Cape Town, or London, or Tilgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, he would do much as Guy himself had done when he discovered
      Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s theft of the six thousand. He would follow the
      villain till he ran him to earth, and would tax him at last to his face
      with the open proofs of his consummate treachery. What&rsquo;s bred in the
      bone will out in the blood. The Kelmscott strain worked alike its own way
      in each of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Namaqua, to be sure, tried in vain to explain to Granville by
      elaborate signs that the other white man had given orders to the contrary.
      The other white man had strictly enjoined upon him not to let the invalid
      escape from his hut on any pretext whatever. The other white man had
      promised him a reward, a very large reward&mdash;money, guns, ammunition&mdash;if
      he kept him safely and didn&rsquo;t allow him to escape. Granville
      Kelmscott smiled to himself a bitter, cynical, smile. Poor confiding
      savage! He didn&rsquo;t know Guy as well as he, his brother, did.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, in the midst of it all, in spite of the revulsion, Granville was
      conscious now and then of some little ingratitude somewhere to his
      half-brother&rsquo;s memory. After all, Guy had shown him time and again
      no small kindness. Some excuse should be made for a man who saves his own
      life first in very dire extremities. But none, no, none for one who has
      the incredible and inhuman meanness to rob his own brother of his
      hard-earned gams, in a strange wild land, when he thinks him dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      For it was the robbery, not the desertion, Granville could never forgive.
      The man who was capable of doing that basest of acts was capable also of
      murder or any crime in the decalogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the fevered white man rose at last one morning on his shrunken limbs,
      and staggered, as best he might, from his protector&rsquo;s hut in a wild
      impulse of resolution, on his mad journey seaward. When the Namaqua saw
      nothing on earth would induce him to remain, he shouldered his arms and
      went out beside him, fully equipped for fight with matchlock and assegai.
      Not that the savage made any undue pretence to a purely personal devotion
      to the belated white man. On the contrary, he signified to Granville with
      many ingenious signs that he was afraid of losing the great reward he had
      been promised, if once he let the invalid get out of his sight unattended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville smiled once more that bitter smile of new-born cynicism. Well,
      let the fellow follow him if he liked! He would reward him himself if ever
      they reached the coast in safety. And in any case, it was better to go
      attended by a native. An interpreter who can communicate in their own
      tongue with the people through whose territory you are going to pass is
      always, useful in a savage country.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Granville got over that terrible journey seaward he could never tell.
      He crawled on and on, supported by the faithful Namaqua with unfailing
      good-humour, over that endless veldt, for three long days of wretched
      footsore marching. And for three long nights he slept, or lay awake, under
      the clear desert stars, on the open ground of barren Namaqua land. It was
      a terrible time. Worn and weary with the fever, Granville was wholly unfit
      for any kind of travelling. Nothing but the iron constitution of the
      Kelmscotts could ever have stood so severe an ordeal. But the son of six
      generations of soldiers, who had commanded in the fever-stricken flats of
      Walcheren, or followed Wellesley through the jungles of tropical India, or
      forced their way with Napier into the depths of Abyssinia, was not to be
      daunted even by the nameless horrors of that South African desert.
      Granville still endured, for three days and nights, and was ready to
      march, or crawl on, once more, upon the fourth morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, however, his Namaqua, guide, with every appearance of terror, made
      strong warnings of danger. The country beyond, he signified by strange
      gestures, lay in the hands of a hostile tribe, hereditarily at war with
      his fellow-clansmen. He didn&rsquo;t even know whether the other white
      man, with the diamonds round his waist, had got safely through, or whether
      the hostile tribe beyond the frontier had assegaied him and &ldquo;eaten
      him up,&rdquo; as the picturesque native phrase goes. It was difficult
      enough for even a strong warrior to force his way through that district
      with a good company of followers; impossible for a single weak invalid
      like Granville, attended only by one poor, ill-armed Namaqua.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the savage seemed to say in his ingenious pantomime. If they went on,
      they&rsquo;d be killed and eaten up resistlessly. If they stopped they
      might pull through. They must wait and camp there. For what they were to
      wait, Granville hadn&rsquo;t the faintest conception. But the Namaqua
      insisted upon it, and Granville was helpless as a child in his hands. The
      man was alarmed, apparently, for his promised reward. If Granville
      insisted, he showed in very frank dumb show, why&mdash;a thrust with the
      assegai explained the rest most persuasively. Granville still had his
      revolver, to be sure, and a few rounds of ball cartridge. But he was too
      weak to show fight; the savage overmastered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were seated on a stony ridge or sharp hog&rsquo;s back, overlooking
      the valley of a dry summer stream. The watershed on which they sat
      separated, with its chine of rugged rocks, the territory of the two rival
      tribes. But the Namaqua was evidently very little afraid that the enemy
      might transgress the boundaries of his fellow-tribesmen. He dared not
      himself go beyond the jagged crest of the ridge; but he seemed to think it
      pretty certain the people of the other tribe wouldn&rsquo;t, for their
      part, in turn come across to molest him. He sat down there doggedly, as if
      expecting something or other to turn up in the course of time; and more
      than once he made signs to Granville which the Englishman interpreted to
      mean that after so many days and nights from some previous event
      unspecified, somebody would arrive on the track from the coast at the
      point of junction between the hostile races.
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville was gazing at the Namaqua in the vain attempt to interpret these
      signs more fully to himself, when, all of a sudden, an unexpected noise in
      the valley below attracted his attention. He pricked up his ears,
      Impossible! Incredible! It couldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;yes, it was&mdash;the
      sharp hiss of firearms!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very same moment the Namaqua leapt to his feet in sudden alarm,
      and, shading his eyes with his dusky hand, gazed intently in front of him.
      For a minute or so he stood still, with brows knit and neck craning. Then
      he called out something in an excited tone two or three times over in his
      own tongue to Granville. The Englishman stared in the same direction, but
      could make out nothing definite just at first, in the full glare of the
      sunlight. But the Namaqua, with a cry of joy, held up his two fingers as
      before, to symbolize the two white men, and pointed with one of them to
      his guest, while with the other he indicated some object in the valley,
      nodding many times over. Granville seized his meaning at once. Could it be
      true, what he said in this strange mute language? Could relief be at hand?
      Could the firing beneath show that Guy was returning?
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked and strained his eyes, peering down upon the red plain, under
      the shadow of his open palm, the objects by the water-course grew
      gradually clearer. Granville could make out now that a party of natives,
      armed with spears and matchlocks, was attacking some little encampment on
      the bank of the dry torrent. The small force in the encampment was
      returning the fire with great vigour and spirit, though apparently
      over-powered by the superior numbers of their swarming assailants. Even as
      Granville looked, their case grew more desperate. A whole horde of black
      men seemed to be making an onset on some small white object, most
      jealously guarded, round which the defenders of the camp rallied with
      infinite energy. At the head of the little band of strangers, a European
      in a pith helmet was directing the fire, and fighting hard himself for the
      precious white object. The rest were blacks, he thought, in half-civilized
      costume. Granville&rsquo;s heart gave a bound as the leader sprang forth
      upon one approaching savage. His action, as he leapt, stamped the man at
      once. There was Kelmscott in the leap. Granville knew in a second it was
      indeed Guy Waring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Namaqua recognised him too, and pointed enthusiastically forward.
      Granville saw what he meant. To the front! To the front! If there was
      fighting to be done, let them help their friends. Let them go forward and
      claim the great reward offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment, with a painful thrill of shame and remorse, the Englishman
      saw what was the nature of the object they were so jealously guarding. His
      heart stood still within him. It was a sort of sedan chair, or invalid
      litter, borne on poles by four native porters. Talk about coals of fire!
      Granville Kelmscott hardly knew how to forgive himself for his unworthy
      distrust. Then Guy must have reached the coast in safety, after leaving
      him in charge of the Namaqua and fighting his way through, and now he was
      on his way back to the interior again, with a sufficient escort and a
      palanquin to fetch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as he looked, the assailants closed in more fiercely than ever on the
      faltering little band. One of them thrust out with an assegai at Guy. In
      an agony of horror, Granville cried aloud where he stood. Surely, surely,
      they must be crushed to earth. No arms of precision could ever avail them
      against such a swarm of assailants, poured forth over their camp as if
      from some human ant-hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us run!&rdquo; the sick man cried to the Namaqua, pointing to
      the fight below; and the Namaqua, comprehending the gesture, if not the
      words, set forward to run with him down the slope into the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      At about a hundred yards off from the crowd, Granville, crouched behind a
      clump of thorny acacia, and, signalling to the Namaqua to hide at the same
      time, drew his revolver and fired point-blank at the hindmost natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect was electrical. In a moment the savages turned and gazed around
      them astonished. One of their number was hit and wounded in the leg.
      Granville had aimed so purposely, to maim and terrify them. The natives
      faltered and fell back. As they did so, Granville emerged from the shelter
      of the acacia bush, and fired a second shot from another point at them. At
      the same instant the Namaqua raised a loud native battle-cry, and
      brandished his assegai. The effect was electrical. The hostile tribe broke
      up in wild panic at once. They cried in their own tongue that the Namaquas
      were down upon them, under English guidance: and, quick as lightning, they
      dispersed as if by magic, to hide themselves about in the thick bush
      jungle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two seconds later, Guy was wringing Granville&rsquo;s hand in a fervour of
      gratitude. Each man had saved the other&rsquo;s life. In the rapid
      interchange of question and answer that followed, one point alone puzzled
      them both for a minute or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why on earth didn&rsquo;t you leave a line to explain what you&rsquo;d
      done?&rdquo; Granville cried, now thoroughly ashamed of his unbelief,
      &ldquo;If only I&rsquo;d known, you were coming back to the village it
      would have saved me so much distress, so much sleepless misery.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, so I did,&rdquo; Guy answered, still thoroughly out of breath,
      and stained with blood and powder. &ldquo;I tore a leaf from my note-book
      and gave it to the Namaqua, explaining to him by signs that he was to let
      you have it at once, the moment you were conscious. Here, you, sir,&rdquo;
      he went on, turning round to their faithful black ally, and holding up the
      note-book before his eyes to refresh his memory, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t
      you give it to the gentleman as I told you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Namaqua, catching hastily at the meaning from the mere tone of the
      question, as well as from Guy&rsquo;s instinctive and graphic imitation of
      the act of writing, pulled out from his waistband the last relics of a
      very brown and tattered fragment of paper, on which were still legible in
      pencil the half-obliterated words: &ldquo;My dear Granville,&mdash;I find
      there is no chance of conveying you to the coast through the territory of
      the next tribe in your present condition, unless&mdash;-&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest was torn off. Guy looked at it dubiously. But the Namaqua,
      anxious to show he had followed out all instructions to the very letter,
      tore off the next scrap before their eyes, rolled it up between his palms
      into a nice greasy pill, and proceeded to offer it for Granville&rsquo;s
      acceptance. The misapprehension was too absurd. Guy went off into a hearty
      peal of laughter at once. The Namaqua had taken the mysterious signs for
      &ldquo;a very great medicine,&rdquo; and had administered the magical
      paper accordingly, as he understood himself to be instructed, at fixed
      intervals to his unfortunate patient. That was the medicine Granville
      remembered having forced down his throat at the moment when he first
      learned, as he thought, his half-brother&rsquo;s treachery.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII. &mdash; NEWS FROM THE CAPE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the Holkers&rsquo; at Chetwood, one evening some days later, Cyril
      Waring met Elma Clifford once more, the first time for months, and had
      twenty minutes&rsquo; talk in the tea-room alone with her. Contrary to his
      rule, he had gone to the Holkers&rsquo; party that night, for a man can&rsquo;t
      remain a recluse all his life, no matter how hard he tries, merely because
      his brother&rsquo;s suspected of having committed a murder. In course of
      time, the attitude palls upon him. For the first year after Guy&rsquo;s
      sudden and mysterious disappearance, indeed, Cyril refused all invitations
      point-blank, except from the most intimate friends; the shame and disgrace
      of that terrible episode weighed him down so heavily that he couldn&rsquo;t
      bear to go out in the world among unsympathetic strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the deepest sorrow wears away by degrees, and at the end of twelve
      months Cyril found he could mix a little more unreservedly at last among
      his fellow-men. The hang-dog air sat ill upon his frank, free nature. This
      invitation to the Holkers&rsquo;, too, had one special attraction: he knew
      it was a house where he was almost certain of meeting Elma. And since Elma
      insisted now on writing to him constantly&mdash;she was a self-willed
      young woman was Elma, and would have her way&mdash;he really saw no reason
      on earth himself why he shouldn&rsquo;t meet her. To meet is one thing,
      don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;to marry, another. At least so fifty
      generations of young people have deluded themselves under similar
      circumstances into believing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma was in the room before him, prettier than ever, people said, in the
      pale red ball-dress which exactly suited her gipsy-like eyes and creamy
      complexion. As she entered she saw Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve with his wife
      and Gwendoline standing in the corner by the big piano. Gwendoline looked
      pale and preoccupied, as she had always looked since Granville Kelmscott
      disappeared, leaving behind him no more definite address for love-letters
      than simply Africa; and Lady Gildersleeve was, as usual, quite subdued and
      broken. But the judge himself, consoled by his new honours, seemed, as
      time wore on, to have recovered a trifle of his old blustering manner. A
      knighthood had reassured him. He was talking to Mr. Holker in a loud voice
      as Elma approached him from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a very curious coincidence,&rdquo; he was just saying, in his
      noisy fashion, with one big burly hand held demonstratively before him.
      &ldquo;A very curious and unexplained coincidence. They both vanished into
      space about the self-same time. And nothing more has ever since been heard
      of them. Quite an Arabian Nights&rsquo; affair in its way&mdash;the
      Enchanted Carpet sort of business, don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;wafted
      through the air unawares, like Sinbad the Sailor, or the One-eyed
      Calender, from London to Bagdad, or Timbuctoo or St. Petersburg. The OTHER
      young man one understands about, of course; HE had sufficient reasons of
      his own, no doubt, for leaving a country which had grown too warm for him.
      But that Granville Kelmscott, a gentleman of means, the heir to such a
      fine estate as Tilgate, should disappear into infinity leaving no trace
      behind, like a lost comet&mdash;and at the very moment, too, when he was
      just about to come into the family property&mdash;why, I call it... I call
      it... I call it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His jaw dropped suddenly. He grew deadly pale. Words failed his stammering
      tongue. Do what he would, he couldn&rsquo;t finish his sentence. And yet,
      nothing very serious had occurred to him in any way. It was merely that,
      as he uttered these words, he caught Elma Clifford&rsquo;s eye, and saw
      lurking in it a certain gleam of deadly contempt before which the big
      blustering man himself had quailed more than once in many a Surrey
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve knew, as well as if she had told him the
      truth in so many words, that Elma Clifford suspected him of being Montague
      Nevitt&rsquo;s murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma came forward, just to break the awkward pause, and shook hands with
      the party by the piano coldly. Sir Gilbert tried to avoid her; but, with
      the inherited instinct of her race, Elma cut off his retreat. She boxed
      him in the corner between the piano and the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard what you were saying just now, Sir Gilbert,&rdquo; she
      murmured low, but with marked emphasis, after a few polite commonplaces of
      conversation had first passed between them; &ldquo;and I want to ask you
      one question only about the matter. ARE you so sure as you seem of what
      you said this minute? Are you so sure that Mr. Guy Waring HAD sufficient
      reasons of his own for wishing to leave the country?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that unflinching eye, the great lawyer trembled, as many a witness
      had trembled of old under his own cross-examination. But he tried to pass
      it off just at first with a little society banter. He bowed, and smiled,
      and pretended to look arch&mdash;look arch, indeed, with that ashen, white
      face of his!&mdash;as he answered, with forced humour&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady, Mr. Guy Waring, as I understand, is Mr. Cyril
      Waring&rsquo;s brother, and as by the law of England the king can do no
      wrong, so I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma cut him short in the middle of his sentence with an imperious
      gesture. He had never cut short an obnoxious and intruding barrister
      himself with more crushing dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cyril Waring has nothing at all to do with the point, one way
      or the other,&rdquo; the girl said severely. &ldquo;Attend to my question.
      What I ask is this: Why do you, a judge who may one day be called upon to
      try the case, venture to say, on such partial evidence, that Mr. Guy
      Waring had sufficient reasons of his own for leaving the country?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Called upon to try Guy Waring&rsquo;s case! The judge paused abashed. He
      was very much afraid of her. This girl had such a strange look about the
      eyes, she made him tremble. People said the Ewes women were the
      descendants of a witch. And there was something truly witch-like in the
      way Elma Clifford looked straight down into his eyes. She seemed to see
      into his very soul. He knew she suspected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shuffled and temporized. &ldquo;Well, everybody says so, you know,&rdquo;
      he answered, shrugging his shoulders carelessly. &ldquo;And what everybody
      says MUST be true. ... Besides, if HE, didn&rsquo;t do it, who did, I
      wonder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma pounced upon her opportunity with a woman&rsquo;s quickness. &ldquo;Somebody
      else who was at Mambury that day, no doubt,&rdquo; she replied, with a
      meaning look. &ldquo;It MUST have been somebody out of the few who were at
      Mambury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That home-thrust told. The judge&rsquo;s colour was livid to look upon.
      What could this girl mean? How on earth could she know? How had she even
      found out he was at Mambury at all? A terrible doubt oppressed his soul.
      Had Gwendoline confided his movements to Elma? He had warned his daughter
      time and again not to mention the fact, &ldquo;for fear of
      misapprehension,&rdquo; he said, with shuffling eyes askance. It was
      better nobody should know he had been anywhere near Dartmoor on the day of
      the accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, there was one consolation; the law! the law! She could have no
      legal proof, and intuition goes for nothing in a court of justice. All the
      suspicion went against Guy Waring, and Guy Waring&mdash;well, Guy Waring
      had fled the kingdom in the very nick of time, and was skulking now,
      Heaven alone knew where or why, in the remotest depths of some far African
      diggings.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even as he thought it, the servant opened the door, and, in the
      regulation footman&rsquo;s voice, announced &ldquo;Mr. Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge started afresh. For one moment his senses deceived him sadly.
      His mind was naturally full of Guy, just now; and as the servant spoke, he
      saw a handsome young man in evening dress coming up the long drawing-room
      with the very air and walk of the man he had met that eventful afternoon
      at the &ldquo;Duke of Devonshire&rdquo; at Plymouth. Of course, it was
      only Cyril; and a minute later the judge saw his mistake, and remembered,
      with a bitter smile, how conscience makes cowards of us all, as he had
      often remarked about shaky witnesses in his admirable perorations. But
      Elma hadn&rsquo;t failed to notice either the start or its reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Mr. Cyril,&rdquo; she said pointedly; &ldquo;not
      Mr. Guy, Sir Gilbert. The name came very pat, though. I don&rsquo;t wonder
      it startled you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was crimson herself. The judge moved away with a stealthy
      uncomfortable air. He didn&rsquo;t half care for this uncanny young woman.
      A girl who can read people&rsquo;s thoughts like that, a girl who can play
      with you like a cat with a mouse, oughtn&rsquo;t to be allowed at large in
      society. She should be shut up in a cage at home like a dangerous animal,
      and prevented from spying out the inmost history of families.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later, Elma had twenty minutes&rsquo; talk with Cyril alone. It
      was in the tea-room behind, where the light refreshments were laid out
      before supper. She spoke low and seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cyril,&rdquo; she said, in a tone of absolute confidence&mdash;they
      were not engaged, of course, but still, it had got to plain &ldquo;Cyril&rdquo;
      and &ldquo;Elma&rdquo; by this time&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m surer of it
      than ever, no matter what you say. Guy&rsquo;s perfectly innocent. I know
      it as certainly as I know my own name. I can&rsquo;t be mistaken. And the
      man who really did it is, as I told you, Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; Cyril answered&mdash;you call the girl you
      are in love with &ldquo;my dear child,&rdquo; when you mean to differ from
      her, with an air of masculine superiority&mdash;&ldquo;how on earth can
      that be, when, as I told you, I have Guy&rsquo;s confession in writing,
      under his own very hand, that he really did it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a pin for that,&rdquo; Elma cried, with a true
      woman&rsquo;s contempt for anything so unimportant as mere positive
      evidence. &ldquo;Perhaps Sir Gilbert made him do it somehow&mdash;compelled
      him, or coerced him, or willed him, or something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      understand these new notions&mdash;or perhaps he got him into a scrape and
      then hadn&rsquo;t the courage or the manliness to get him out of it. But
      at any rate, I can answer for one thing, I were to go to the stake for it&mdash;Sir
      Gilbert Gildersleeve is the man who&rsquo;s really guilty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, a great shadow darkened the door of the room for a moment
      ominously. Sir Gilbert looked in with a lady on his arm&mdash;the
      inevitable dowager who refreshes herself continuously at frequent
      intervals through six hours of entertainment. When he saw those two
      tête-à-tête, he drew back, somewhat disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s go in there, Lady Knowles,&rdquo; he
      whispered to the dowager by his side. &ldquo;A pair of young people
      discussing their hearts. We were once young ourselves. It&rsquo;s a pity
      to disturb them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he passed on across the hall towards the great refreshment-room
      opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Cyril said bitterly, as the judge
      disappeared through the opposite door. &ldquo;I wish I could agree with
      you. But I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t. The burden of it&rsquo;s heavier
      than my shoulders can bear. Guy&rsquo;s weak, I know, and might be led
      half unawares into certain sorts of crime; yet I only knew one man ever
      likely to lead him&mdash;and that was poor Nevitt himself, not Sir Gilbert
      Gildersleeve, whom he hardly even knew to speak to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he paused and reflected, a servant with a salver came up and looked
      into Cyril&rsquo;s face inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; he said, hesitating, &ldquo;but I
      think you&rsquo;re Mr. Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name,&rdquo; Cyril answered, with a faint blush on
      his cheek. &ldquo;Do you want to speak to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; there&rsquo;s half-a-crown to pay for porterage, if you
      please. A telegram for you, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril pulled out the half-a-crown, and tore open the telegram. Its
      contents were indeed enough to startle him. It was dated &ldquo;Cape Town,&rdquo;
      and was as brief as is the wont of cable messages at nine shillings a word&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming home immediately to repay everything and stand my trial.
      Kelmscott accompanies me. All well.&mdash;GUY WARING.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril looked at it with a gasp, and handed it on to Elma. Elma took it in
      her dainty gloved fingers, and read it through with keen eyes of absorbing
      interest. Cyril sighed a profound sigh. Elma glanced back at him all
      triumph. &ldquo;I told you so,&rdquo; she said, in a very jubilant voice.
      &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t do that if he didn&rsquo;t KNOW he was innocent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very same second, a blustering voice was heard above the murmur in
      the hall without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, half-a-crown for porterage!&rdquo; it exclaimed in indignant
      tones. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s a clear imposition. The people at my house
      ought never to have sent it on. It&rsquo;s addressed to Woodlands.
      Unimportant, unimportant! Here, Gwendoline, take your message&mdash;some
      milliner&rsquo;s or dressmaker&rsquo;s appointment for to-morrow, I
      suppose. Half-a-crown for porterage! They&rsquo;d no right to bring it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendoline took the telegram with trembling hands, tore it open all
      quivers, and broke into a cry of astonishment. Then she fell all at once
      into her father&rsquo;s arms. Elma understood it all. It was a similar
      message from Granville Kelmscott to tell the lady of his heart he was
      coming home to marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Gilbert, somewhat flustered, called for water in haste, and revived
      the fainting girl by bathing her temples. At last he took up the cause of
      the mischief himself. As he read it his own face turned white as death.
      Elma noticed that, too. And no wonder it did&mdash;for these were the
      words of that unexpected message&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming home to claim you by the next mail. Guy Waring accompanies
      me.&mdash;GRANVILLE KELMSCOTT.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX. &mdash; A GLEAM OF LIGHT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next day but one, the Companion of St. Michael and St. George came in to
      Craighton with evil tidings. He had heard in the village that Sir Gilbert
      Gildersleeve was ill&mdash;very seriously ill. The judge had come home
      from the Holkers&rsquo; the other evening much upset by the arrival of
      Gwendoline&rsquo;s telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though why on earth should that upset him,&rdquo; Mr. Clifford
      continued, screwing up his small face with a very wise air, &ldquo;is more
      than I can conceive; for I&rsquo;m sure the Gildersleeves angled hard
      enough in their time to catch young Kelmscott, by hook or by crook, for
      their gawky daughter; and now that young Kelmscott telegraphs over to say
      he&rsquo;s coming home post haste to marry her, Miss Gwendoline faints
      away, if you please, as she reads the news, and the judge himself goes
      upstairs as soon as he gets home, and takes to his bed incontinently. But
      there, the ways of the world are really inscrutable! What reconciles me to
      life, every day I grow older, is that it&rsquo;s so amusing&mdash;so
      intensely amusing! You never know what&rsquo;s going to turn up next; and
      what you least expect is what most often happens.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma, however, received his news with a very grave face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he really ill, do you think, papa?&rdquo; she asked, somewhat
      anxiously; &ldquo;or is he only&mdash;well&mdash;only frightened?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clifford stared at her with a blank leathery face of self-satisfied
      incomprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frightened!&rdquo; he repeated solemnly; &ldquo;Sir Gilbert
      Gildersleeve frightened! And of Granville Kelmscott, too! That&rsquo;s
      true wit, Elma; the juxtaposition of the incongruous. Why, what on earth
      has the man got to be frightened of, I should like to know? ... No, no; he&rsquo;s
      really ill; very seriously ill. Humphreys says the case is a most peculiar
      one, and he&rsquo;s telegraphed up to town for a specialist to come down
      this afternoon and consult with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, Sir Gilbert was really very ill. This unexpected shock had
      wholly unmanned him. To say the truth, the judge had begun to look upon
      Guy Waring as practically lost, and upon the matter of Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s
      death as closed for ever. Waring, no doubt, had gone to Africa&mdash;under
      a false name&mdash;and proceeded to the diamond fields direct, where he
      had probably been killed in a lucky quarrel with some brother digger, or
      stuck through with an assegai by some enterprising Zulu; and nobody had
      even taken the trouble to mention it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s so easy for a man to get lost in the crowd in the Dark
      Continent! Why, there was Granville Kelmscott, even&mdash;a young fellow
      of means, and the heir of Tilgate, about whom Gwendoline was always
      moaning and groaning, poor girl, and wouldn&rsquo;t be comforted&mdash;there
      was Granville Kelmscott gone out to Africa, and, hi, presto, disappeared
      into space without a vapour or a trace, like a conjurer&rsquo;s shilling.
      It was all very queer; but, then, queer things are the way in Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, Sir Gilbert had his qualms of conscience, too, over having
      thus sent off Guy Waring, as he believed, to his grave in Cape Colony. He
      was not at heart a bad man, though he was pushing, and selfish, and
      self-seeking, and to a certain extent even&mdash;of late&mdash;unscrupulous.
      He had his bad half-hours every now and again with his own moral
      consciousness. But he had learnt to stifle his doubts and to keep down his
      terrors. After all, he had told Guy no more than the truth; and if Guy in
      his panic-terror chose to run away and get killed in South Africa, that
      was no fault of HIS&mdash;he&rsquo;d only tried to warn the fellow of an
      impending danger. All&rsquo;s well that ends well; and, to-day, Guy Waring
      was lost or dead, while he himself was a judge, and a knight to boot, with
      all trace of his crime destroyed for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he said to himself, rejoicing, the very day Granville Kelmscott&rsquo;s
      telegram arrived. But now that he stood face to face again with that
      pressing terror, his thoughts on the matter were very different. Strange
      to say, his first idea was this: what a disgraceful shame of that fellow
      Waring to come to life again thus suddenly on purpose to annoy him! He was
      really angry, nay, more, indignant. Such shuffling was inexcusable. If
      Waring meant to give himself up and stand his trial like a man, why the
      dickens didn&rsquo;t he do it immediately after the&mdash;well, the
      accident? What did he mean by going off for eighteen months undiscovered,
      and leaving one to build up fresh plans in life, like this&mdash;and then
      coming home on a sudden just on purpose to upset them? It was simply
      disgraceful. Sir Gilbert felt injured; this man Waring was wronging him.
      Eighteen months before he was keenly aware that he was unjustly casting a
      vile and hideous suspicion on an innocent person. But in the intervening
      period his moral sense had got largely blunted. Familiarity with the
      hateful plot had warped his ideas about it. Their places were reversed.
      Sir Gilbert was really aggrieved now that Guy Waring should turn up again,
      and should venture to vindicate his deeply-wronged character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was as good as dead. Well, and he ought to have stopped so; or
      else he ought never to have died at all. He ought to have kept himself
      continually in evidence. But to go away for eighteen months, unknown and
      unheard of, till one&rsquo;s sense of security had had time to
      re-establish itself, and then to turn up again like this without one
      minute&rsquo;s warning&mdash;oh, it was infamous, scandalous. The fellow
      must be devoid of all consideration for others. Sir Gilbert wiped his
      clammy brow with those ample hands. What on earth was he to do for his
      wife, and for Gwendoline?
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gwendoline was so happy, too, over Granville Kelmscott&rsquo;s return!
      How could he endure that Granville Kelmscott&rsquo;s return should be the
      signal for discovering her father&rsquo;s sin and shame to her! If only he
      could have married her off before it all came out! Or if only he could die
      before the man was tried!&mdash;Tried! Sir Gilbert&rsquo;s eyes started
      from his head with horror. What was that Elma Clifford suggested the other
      night? Why&mdash;if the man was arrested, he would be arrested at
      Plymouth, the moment he landed, and would be tried for murder at the
      Western Assizes. And it was he himself, Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve, who was
      that term to take the Western Circuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would be called upon to sit on the bench himself, and try Guy Waring
      for the murder he had himself committed!
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder that thought sent him ill to bed at once. He lay and tossed all
      night long in speechless agony and terror. It was an appalling night. Next
      morning he was found delirious with fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the news reached Elma, she saw its full and fatal significance. Cyril
      had stopped on for three days at the Holkers&rsquo;, and he came over in
      the course of the morning to take a walk across the fields with her. Elma
      was profoundly excited, Cyril could hardly see why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a terrible thing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;about Sir Gilbert&rsquo;s
      illness. What I&rsquo;m afraid of now is that he may die before your
      brother returns. The shock must have been awful for him; mamma noticed it
      every bit as much as I did; and so did Miss Ewes. They both said at once,
      &lsquo;This blow will kill him!&rsquo; And they both knew why, Cyril, as
      well as I did. It&rsquo;s the Ewes&rsquo; intuition. We&rsquo;ve all of us
      got it, and we all of us say, at once and unanimously&mdash;it was Sir
      Gilbert Gildersleeve.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose he DID die,&rdquo; Cyril asked, still sceptical, as he
      always was when Elma got upon her instinctive consciousness; &ldquo;what
      difference would that make? If Guy&rsquo;s innocent, as I suppose in some
      way he must be, from the tone of his telegram, he&rsquo;ll be acquitted
      whether Sir Gilbert&rsquo;s alive or not. And if he&rsquo;s guilty&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off suddenly with an awful pause; the other alternative was too
      terrible to contemplate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s NOT guilty,&rdquo; Elma answered with confidence.
      &ldquo;I know it more surely now than ever. And the difficulty&rsquo;s
      this. Nobody knows the real truth, I feel certain, except Sir Gilbert
      Gildersleeve. And if Sir Gilbert dies unconfessed, the truth dies with
      him. And then&mdash;&rdquo; She paused a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half
      afraid,&rdquo; she went on with a doubtful sigh, &ldquo;your brother&rsquo;s
      been too precipitate in coming home to face it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Elma,&rdquo; Cyril cried, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to say it&mdash;yet
      one must face the facts&mdash;how on earth can he be innocent, when I tell
      you again and again he wrote to me himself saying he really did it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never showed me that letter,&rdquo; Elma answered, with a faint
      undercurrent of reproach in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I?&rdquo; Cyril replied. &ldquo;Even to YOU, Elma, there
      are some things a man can hardly bear to speak about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have more faith than you, Cyril,&rdquo; Elma answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      never given up believing in Guy all the time. I believe in him still&mdash;because
      I know he&rsquo;s your brother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short pause, during which neither spoke. They walked along
      together, looking at each other&rsquo;s faces with half downcast eyes, but
      with the not unpleasant sense of mute companionship and sympathy in a
      great sorrow. At last Elma spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was one thing in Guy&rsquo;s telegram,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite understand. &lsquo;Coming home immediately to
      repay everything.&rsquo; What did he mean by that? What has that got to do
      with Mr. Nevitt&rsquo;s disappearance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was quite another matter,&rdquo; Cyril answered, blushing
      deep with shame, for he couldn&rsquo;t bear to let Elma know Guy was a
      forger as well as a murderer. &ldquo;That was something purely personal
      between us two. He&mdash;he owed me money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma&rsquo;s keen eyes read him through at a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he said it all in one sentence,&rdquo; she objected, &ldquo;as
      if the two went naturally together. Coming home immediately to repay
      everything and stand my trial. Cyril, Cyril, you&rsquo;ve held something
      back. I believe there&rsquo;s some fearful mistake here somewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; Cyril answered, feeling more and more
      uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; Elma replied, with a thrill, reading
      his thoughts still deeper. &ldquo;Oh, Cyril&rdquo;&mdash;she seized his
      arm with a convulsive grip&mdash;&ldquo;for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, go and
      get it; let me see that letter!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it here,&rdquo; Cyril answered, pulling it out with some
      shame from Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s pocket-book, which he wouldn&rsquo;t
      destroy, and dared not leave about for prying eyes to light upon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      carried it day and night, ever since, about with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma seized it from his hands, and sat down upon a stile, and read it
      through with profound attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end she handed it back and tears stood in her eyes. &ldquo;Cyril,&rdquo;
      she said, half laughing hysterically and half crying as she spoke, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
      been doing that poor fellow a deep injustice. Oh, don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you see it? That isn&rsquo;t the letter of a man who has committed a
      murder. It&rsquo;s the letter of a man who has unwittingly and unwillingly
      done you some personal wrong, and is eager to repair it. My darling, my
      darling, you&rsquo;ve misread it altogether. It isn&rsquo;t about Montague
      Nevitt&rsquo;s death at all; it&rsquo;s about nothing an earth but some
      private money matter. More than that, when it was written, Guy didn&rsquo;t
      yet know Mr. Nevitt was dead. He didn&rsquo;t know he was suspected. He
      didn&rsquo;t know anything. I wonder you don&rsquo;t see! I wish to Heaven
      you&rsquo;d shown me that letter months ago! Sir Gilbert fastened
      suspicion on the wrong man; and this letter has made you accept it too
      easily. Guy went to Africa&mdash;that&rsquo;s as plain as words can put it&mdash;to
      make money of his own to repay what he owed you. And it&rsquo;s this, the
      purely personal and unimportant charge, he&rsquo;s coming home to give
      himself up upon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A light seemed to burst on Cyril&rsquo;s mind as she spoke. For the very
      first time, he felt a gleam of hope. Elma was right, after all, he
      believed. Guy was wholly innocent of the greater crime; and his
      heart-broken letter had only meant to deal with the question of the
      forgery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Cyril had heard of the murder first, and had had that most in his mind
      when the letter reached him; so he interpreted it at once as referring to
      the capital charge, and never dreamt for a moment of its real narrower
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, when the messenger came back from &ldquo;kind inquiries&rdquo;
      at Woodlands, Elma asked, with hushed awe, how Sir Gilbert was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very poorly, miss,&rdquo; the servant answered. &ldquo;The doctor
      says he&rsquo;s sunk dreadful low; and the butler thinks he has something
      on his mind he can&rsquo;t get out in his wanderings. He&rsquo;s in a
      terrible bad way. They wouldn&rsquo;t be astonished if he don&rsquo;t live
      to morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So Elma went to bed that night trembling most for the result of Sir
      Gilbert&rsquo;s illness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL. &mdash; THE BOLT FALLS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      All the way home on that long journey from Cape Town, as the two
      half-brothers lounged on deck together in their canvas chairs, Granville
      Kelmscott was wholly at a loss to understand what seemed to him Guy Waring&rsquo;s
      unaccountable and almost incredible levity. The man&rsquo;s conduct didn&rsquo;t
      in the least resemble that of a person who is returning to give himself up
      on a charge of wilful murder. On the contrary, Guy showed no signs of
      remorse or mental agony in any way; he seemed rather elated, instead, at
      the pleasing thought that he was going home, with his diamonds all turned
      at the Cape into solid coin, to make his peace once more with his brother
      Cyril.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, at times he did casually allude to some expected
      unpleasantness when he arrived in England; yet he treated it, Granville
      noticed, as though hanging were at worst but a temporary inconvenience.
      Granville wondered whether, after all, he could have some complete and
      crushing answer to that appalling charge; on any other supposition, his
      spirits and his talk were really little short of what one might expect
      from a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed, now and again, Granville did really begin to suspect that
      something had gone wrong somewhere with Guy Waring&rsquo;s intellect. The
      more he thought over it, the more likely did this seem, for Guy talked on
      with the greatest composure about his plans for the future &ldquo;when
      this difficulty was cleared up,&rdquo; as though a trial for murder were a
      most ordinary occurrence&mdash;an accident that might happen to any
      gentleman any day. And, if so, was it possible that Guy had gone wrong in
      his head BEFORE the affray with Montague Nevitt? That seemed likely
      enough; for when Granville remembered Guy&rsquo;s invariable gentleness
      and kindness to himself, his devotion in sickness and in the trials of the
      desert, his obvious aversion to do harm to any one, and, above all, his
      heartfelt objection to shedding human blood, Granville was constrained to
      believe his newly found half-brother, if ever he committed the murder at
      all, must have committed it while in a state of unsound mind, deserving
      rather of pity than of moral reprehension. He comforted himself, indeed,
      with this consoling idea&mdash;he could never believe a Kelmscott of
      Tilgate, when clothed and in his right mind, could be guilty of such a
      detestable and motiveless crime as the wilful murder of Montague Nevitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, moreover, the subject that seemed most to occupy Guy
      Waring&rsquo;s mind, on the voyage home, was not his forthcoming trial on
      a capital charge, but the future distribution of the Tilgate property. Was
      he essentially a money-grubber, Granville wondered to himself, as he had
      thought him at first in the diamond fields in Barolong land? Was he
      incapable of thinking about anything but filthy lucre? No; that was
      clearly not the true solution of the problem, for, whenever Guy spoke to
      him about the subject, it was generally to say one and the self-same thing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this matter, I feel I can speak for Cyril as I speak for myself.
      Neither of us would wish to deprive you now of what you&rsquo;ve always
      been brought up to consider as your own. Neither of us would wish to
      dispossess Lady Emily. The most we would desire is this&mdash;to have our
      position openly acknowledged and settled before the world. We should like
      it to be known we were the lawful sons of a brave man and an honest woman.
      And if you wish voluntarily to share with us some part of our father&rsquo;s
      estate, we&rsquo;ll be willing to enter into a reasonable arrangement by
      which yon yourself can retain Tilgate Park and the mass of the property
      that immediately appertains to it. I&rsquo;m sure Cyril would no more wish
      to be grasping in this matter than I am; and after all that you and I have
      gone through together, Granville, I don&rsquo;t think yon need doubt the
      sincerity of my feelings towards you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke so sensibly, he spoke so manfully, he spoke so kindly always,
      with a bright gleam in those tender eyes, that Granville hardly knew what
      to make of his evident confidence. Surely a man couldn&rsquo;t be mad who
      could speak like that; and yet, whenever he alluded in any way to his
      return to England, it was always as though he ignored the gravity and
      heinousness of the charge brought against him. It was as though murder was
      an accident, for which one was hardly responsible. Granville couldn&rsquo;t
      make him out at all; the fellow was an enigma to him. There was so much
      that was good in him; and yet, there must be so much that was bad as well.
      He was such a delicate, considerate, self-effacing gentleman&mdash;and
      yet, if one could believe what he himself more than once as good as
      admitted, he was a criminal, a felon, an open murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, even so, Granville couldn&rsquo;t turn his back upon the brother
      who had seen him so bravely across the terrors of Namaqua land. He thought
      of how he had misjudged him once before, and how much he had repented it.
      Whether Guy was a murderer or not, Granville felt, the man he had saved,
      at least, could never forsake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night before their arrival at Plymouth, Guy was in unusually high
      spirits. His mirth was contagious. Everybody on board was delighted at the
      prospect of reaching land, but Guy was more delighted and more sanguine
      than anybody. He was sure in his own mind this difficulty must have blown
      over long before now; Cyril must have explained; Nevitt must have
      confessed; everything must have been set right, and his own good name
      satisfactorily rehabilitated. For more than eighteen months he had heard
      nothing from England. To-morrow he would see Cyril, and account for
      everything. He had money to set all right&mdash;his hard-earned money, got
      at the risk of his own life in the dreary deserts of Barolong land. All
      would yet be well, and Cyril would marry, and Elma Clifford would be the
      mistress of nearly half the Tilgate property.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all so different, Granville,&rdquo; he said to his friend
      confidentially, as they paced the deck after supper, cigar in mouth,
      &ldquo;when you first went out, and we didn&rsquo;t know one another.
      Then, I distrusted you, and you distrusted me. We didn&rsquo;t understand
      one another&rsquo;s characters. But now we can settle it all as a family
      affair. Men who have camped out together under the open sky on the African
      veldt, who have run the gauntlet of Korannas and Barolong and Namaqua, who
      have stood by one another in sickness and in fight, needn&rsquo;t be
      afraid of disagreeing about their money matters in England. Cyril will
      meet us to-morrow and talk it all over, and I&rsquo;m not the least
      troubled about the result, either for you or for him. The same blood runs
      in all our veins alike. Whatever you propose, he&rsquo;ll be ready to
      agree to. He&rsquo;s the very best fellow that ever lived, and when he
      hears what I have to say about you, he&rsquo;ll welcome you as a brother,
      and be as fond of you as I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning early they reached Plymouth Harbour. As they entered the
      mouth of the breakwater, the tender came alongside to convey them ashore.
      Guy looked over the bulwarks and saw Cyril waiting for him. In a fervour
      of delight at the sight of the green fields and the soft hills of old
      England&mdash;the beautiful Hoe, and the solid stone houses, and the
      familiar face turned up to welcome him&mdash;Guy waved his handkerchief
      round and round his head in triumph; to which demonstration Cyril, as he
      fancied, responded but coldly. A chill fell upon his heart. This was bad,
      but still, after all, he could hardly expect Cyril to know intuitively
      under what sinister influence he had signed that fatal cheque. And yet he
      was disappointed. His heart had jumped so hard at sight of Cyril, he could
      hardly believe Cyril wasn&rsquo;t glad to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stepped into the tender from the gangway, just ready to rush up and
      shake Cyril&rsquo;s hand fervently, a resolute-looking man by the side of
      the steps laid a very firm grip on his shoulder with an air of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guy Waring?&rdquo; he said interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Guy, turning pale, answered without flinching&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my name&rsquo;s Guy Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re my prisoner,&rdquo; the man said, in a very firm
      voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an inspector of constabulary.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what charge?&rdquo; Guy exclaimed, half taken aback at this
      promptitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a warrant against you, sir,&rdquo; the inspector answered,
      &ldquo;as you are no doubt aware, for the wilful murder of Montague
      Nevitt, on the 17th of August, year before last, at Mambury, in
      Devonshire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The word&rsquo;s fell upon Guy&rsquo;s ears with all the suddenness and
      crushing force of an unexpected thunderbolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilful murder,&rdquo; he cried, taken aback by the charge. &ldquo;Wilful
      murder of Montague Nevitt at Mambury! Oh no, you can&rsquo;t mean that!
      Montague Nevitt dead! Montague Nevitt murdered! And at Mambury, too! There
      MUST be some mistake somewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s no mistake at all, this time,&rdquo; the
      inspector said quietly, slipping a pair of handcuffs unobtrusively into
      his pocket as he spoke. &ldquo;If you come along with me without any
      unnecessary noise, we won&rsquo;t trouble to iron you. But you&rsquo;d
      better say as little as possible about the charge just now, for whatever
      you say may be used in evidence at the trial against you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy turned to Cyril with an appealing look. &ldquo;Cyril,&rdquo; he,
      cried, &ldquo;what does all this mean? Is Nevitt dead? It&rsquo;s the very
      first word I&rsquo;ve ever heard about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril&rsquo;s heart gave a bound of wild relief at those words. The moment
      Guy said it his brother knew he spoke the simple truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Guy,&rdquo; he answered, with a fierce burst of joy, &ldquo;then
      you&rsquo;re not a murderer after all? You&rsquo;re innocent! You&rsquo;re
      innocent! And for eighteen months all England has thought you guilty; and
      I&rsquo;ve lived under the burden of being universally considered a
      murderer&rsquo;s brother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy looked him back in the face with those truthful grey eyes of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cyril,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as innocent of
      this charge as you or Granville Kelmscott here. I never even heard one
      whisper of it before. I don&rsquo;t know what it means. I don&rsquo;t know
      who they want. Till this moment I thought Montague Nevitt was still alive
      in England.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he said it, Granville Kelmscott, too, saw he was speaking the
      truth. Impossible as he found it in his own mind to reconcile those
      strange words with all that Guy had said to him in the wilds of Namaqua
      land, he couldn&rsquo;t look him in the face without seeing at a glance
      how profound and unexpected was this sudden surprise to him. He was right
      in saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as innocent of this charge as you or Granville
      Kelmscott.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the inspector only smiled a cynical smile, and answered calmly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for the jury to decide. We shall hear more of this
      then. You&rsquo;ll be tried at the assizes. Meanwhile, the less said, the
      sooner mended.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI. &mdash; WHAT JUDGE?
    </h2>
    <p>
      For many days, meanwhile, Sir Gilbert had hovered between life and death,
      and Elma had watched his illness daily with profound and absorbing
      interest. For in her deep, intuitive way she felt certain to herself that
      their one chance now lay in Sir Gilbert&rsquo;s own sense of remorse and
      repentance. She didn&rsquo;t yet know, to be sure&mdash;what Sir Gilbert
      himself knew&mdash;that if he recovered he would, in all probability, have
      to sit in trial on another man for the crime he had himself committed. But
      she did feel this,&mdash;that Sir Gilbert would surely never stand by and
      let an innocent man die for his own transgression.
    </p>
    <p>
      IF he recovered, that was to say. But perhaps he would not recover.
      Perhaps his life would flicker out by degrees in the midst of his
      delirium, and he would go to his grave unconfessed and unforgiven! Perhaps
      even, for his wife&rsquo;s and daughter&rsquo;s sake, he would shrink from
      revealing what Elma felt to be the truth, and would rest content to die,
      leaving Guy Waring to clear himself at the trial, as best he might, from
      this hateful accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be unjust. It would be criminal. Yet Sir Gilbert might do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma had a bad time, therefore, during all those long days, even before
      Guy returned to England. She knew his life hung by a slender thread, which
      Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve might cut short at any moment. But her anxiety
      was as nothing compared to Sir Gilbert&rsquo;s own. That unhappy man, a
      moral coward at heart, in spite of all his blustering, lay writhing in his
      own room now, very ill, and longing to be worse, longing to die, as the
      easiest way out of this impossible difficulty. For his wife&rsquo;s sake,
      for Gwendoline&rsquo;s sake, it was better he should die; and if only he
      could, he would have left Guy Waring to his fate contentedly. His anger
      against Guy burnt so bright now at last that he would have sacrificed him
      willingly, provided he was not there himself to see and know it. What did
      the man mean by living on to vex him? Over and over again the unhappy
      judge wished himself dead, and prayed to be taken. But that powerful
      frame, though severely broken by the shock, seemed hardly able to yield up
      its life merely because its owner was anxious to part with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a fortnight&rsquo;s severe illness, hovering all the time between
      hope and fear, the doctor came one day, and looked at him hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; Lady Gildersleeve asked, seeing him hold his
      breath and consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her great surprise the doctor answered, &ldquo;Better; against all
      hope, better.&rdquo; And indeed Sir Gilbert was once more convalescent. A
      week or two abroad, it was said, would restore him completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Elma had another terrible source of doubt. Would the doctors order
      Sir Gilbert abroad so long that he would be out of England when the trial
      took place? If so, he might miss many pricks of remorse. She must take
      some active steps to arouse his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Gilbert, himself, now recovering fast, fought hard, as well he might,
      for such leave of absence. He was quite unfit, he said, to return to his
      judicial work so soon. Though he had said nothing about it in public
      before (this was the tenor of his talk) he was a man of profound but
      restrained feelings, and he had felt, he would admit, the absence of
      Gwendoline&rsquo;s lover&mdash;especially when combined with the tragic
      death of Colonel Kelmscott, the father, and the memory of the
      unpleasantness that had once subsisted, through the Colonel&rsquo;s blind
      obstinacy, between the two houses. This sudden news of the young man&rsquo;s
      return had given him a nervous shock of which few would have believed him
      capable. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think to look at me,&rdquo; Sir Gilbert
      said plaintively, smoothing down his bedclothes with those elephantine
      hands of his, &ldquo;I was the sort of man to be knocked down in this way;&rdquo;
      and the great specialist from London, gazing at him with a smile, admitted
      to himself that he certainly would not have thought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense, my dear sir,&rdquo; the specialist answered, however,
      to all his appeals. &ldquo;This is the merest passing turn, I assure you.
      I couldn&rsquo;t conscientiously say you&rsquo;d be unfit for duty by the
      time the assizes come round again. It&rsquo;s clear to me, on the
      contrary, with a physique like yours, you&rsquo;ll pull yourself together
      in something less than no time with a week or so at Spa. Before you&rsquo;re
      due in England to take up harness again you&rsquo;ll be walking miles at a
      stretch over those heathery hills there. Convalescence, with a man like
      you, is a rapid process. In a fortnight from to-day, I&rsquo;ll venture to
      guarantee, you&rsquo;ll be in a fit condition to swim the Channel on your
      back, or to take one of your famous fifty-mile tramps across the bogs of
      Dartmoor. I&rsquo;ll give you a tonic that&rsquo;ll set your nerves all
      right at once. You&rsquo;ll come back from Spa as fresh as a daisy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To Spa, accordingly, Sir Gilbert went; and from Spa came trembling letters
      now and again between Gwendoline and Elma. Gwendoline was very anxious
      papa should get well soon, she said, for she wanted to be home before the
      Cape steamer arrived. &ldquo;You know why, Elma.&rdquo; But Sir Gilbert
      didn&rsquo;t return before Guy&rsquo;s arrival in England, for all that.
      The papers continued to give bulletins of his health, and to speculate on
      the probability of his returning in time to do the Western Circuit. Elma
      remained in a fever of doubt and anxiety. To her, much depended now on the
      question of Sir Gilbert&rsquo;s presence or absence. For if he was indeed
      to try the case, she felt certain to herself, it must work upon his
      remorse and compel confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, preparations went on in England for Guy&rsquo;s approaching
      trial. The magistrates committed; the grand jury, of course, found a true
      bill; all England rang with the strange news that the man Guy Waring, the
      murderer of Mr. Montague Nevitt some eighteen months before, had returned
      at last of his own free will, and had given himself up to take his trial.
      Gildersleeve was to be the judge, they said; or if he were too ill,
      Atkins. Atkins was as sure as a gun to hang him, people thought&mdash;that
      was Atkins&rsquo;s way&mdash;and, besides, the evidence against the man,
      though in a sense circumstantial, was so absolutely overwhelming that
      acquittal seemed impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five to two was freely offered on Change that they&rsquo;d hang him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case was down for first hearing at the assizes. The night before the
      trial Elma Clifford, who had hurried to Devonshire with her mother to see
      and hear all&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t help it, she said; she felt she MUST
      be present&mdash;Elma Clifford looked at the evening paper with a
      sickening sense of suspense and anxiety. A paragraph caught her eye:
      &ldquo;We understand that, after all, Mr. Justice Gildersleeve still finds
      himself too unwell to return to England for the Western Assizes, and his
      place will, therefore, most probably be taken by Mr. Justice Atkins. The
      calendar is a heavy one, and includes the interesting case of Mr. Guy
      Waring, charged with the wilful murder of Montague Nevitt, at Mambury, in
      Devonshire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Elma laid down the paper with a swimming head. Too ill to return. She wasn&rsquo;t
      at all surprised at it. It was almost more than human nature could stand,
      for a man to sit as judge over another to investigate the details of the
      crime he had himself committed. But the suggestion of his absence ruined
      her peace of mind. She couldn&rsquo;t sleep that night. She felt sure now
      there was no hope left. Guy would almost certainly be convicted of murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning she took her seat in court, with her mother and Cyril, as
      soon as the assize hall was opened to the public. But her cheek was very
      pale, and her eyes were weary. Places had been assigned them by the
      courtesy of the authorities, as persons interested in the case; and Elma
      looked eagerly towards the door in the corner, by which, as the usher told
      her, the judge was to enter. There was a long interval, and the usual
      unseemly turmoil of laughing and talking went on among the spectators in
      the well below. Some of them had opera-glasses and stared about them
      freely. Others quizzed the counsel, the officers, and the witnesses. Then
      a hush came over them, and the door opened. Cyril was merely aware of the
      usual formalities and of a judicial wig making its way, with slow dignity,
      to the vacant bench. But Elma leaned forward in a tumult of feeling. Her
      face all at once turned scarlet with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, darling?&rdquo; her mother asked, in a
      sympathetic tone, noticing that something had profoundly stirred her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Elma answered with bated breath, in almost inarticulate tones, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you see? Don&rsquo;t you see, mother? Just look at the judge! It&rsquo;s
      himself! It&rsquo;s Sir Gilbert!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so indeed it was. Against all hope, he had come over. At the very last
      moment a telegram had been handed to the convalescent at Spa:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fallen from my horse. A nasty tumble. Sustained severe internal
      injuries. Impossible to go the Western Circuit, Relieve me if you can.
      Wire reply,&mdash;ATKINS.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Gilbert, as he received it, had just come in from a long ride across
      the wild moors that stretch away from Spa towards Han, and looked the
      picture of health, robust and fresh and ruddy. He glowed with bodily
      vigour; no suspense could kill him. Refusal under such circumstances was
      clearly impossible. He saw he must go, or resign his post at once. So,
      with an agitated heart, he wired acquiescence, took the next train to&mdash;Brussels
      and Calais, and caught the Dover boat just in time for acceptance. And now
      he was there to try Guy Waring for the murder of the man he himself had
      killed in The Tangle at Mambury.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII. &mdash; UNEXPECTED EVIDENCE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve left Spa, he left with a ruddy glow of
      recovered health on his bronzed red cheek; for in spite of anxiety and
      repentance and doubt, the man&rsquo;s iron frame would somehow still
      assert itself. When he took his seat on the bench in court that morning,
      he looked so haggard and ill with fatigue and remorse that even Elma
      Clifford herself pitied him. A hushed whisper ran round among the
      spectators below that the judge wasn&rsquo;t fit to try the case before
      him. And indeed he wasn&rsquo;t. For it was his own trial, not Guy Waring&rsquo;s,
      he was really presiding over.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in his place, a ghastly picture of pallid despair. The red
      colour had faded altogether from his wan, white cheeks. His eyes were
      dreamy and bloodshot with long vigil. His big hands trembled like a woman&rsquo;s
      as he opened his note-book. His mouth twitched nervously. So utter a
      collapse, in such a man as he was, seemed nothing short of pitiable to
      every spectator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Counsel for the Crown stared him steadily in the face. Counsel for the
      Crown&mdash;Forbes-Ewing, Q.C.&mdash;was an old forensic enemy, who had
      fought many a hard battle against Gildersleeve, with scant interchange of
      courtesy, when both were members of the junior Bar together; but now Sir
      Gilbert&rsquo;s look moved even HIM to pity. &ldquo;I think, my lord,&rdquo;
      the Q.C. suggested with a sympathetic simper, &ldquo;your lordship&rsquo;s
      too ill to open the court to-day. Perhaps the proceedings had better be
      adjourned for the present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; the judge answered, almost testily, shaking his
      sleeve with impatience. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no putting off for trifles
      in the court where I sit. There&rsquo;s a capital case to come on this
      morning. When a man&rsquo;s neck&rsquo;s at stake&mdash;when a matter of
      life and death&rsquo;s at issue&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like to keep any one
      longer in suspense than I absolutely need. Delay would be cruel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he lifted his eyes&mdash;and caught Elma Clifford&rsquo;s. The
      judge let his own drop again in speechless agony. Elma&rsquo;s never
      flinched. Neither gave a sign; but Elma knew, as, well as Sir Gilbert knew
      himself, it was his own life and death the judge was thinking of, and not
      Guy Waring&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will, my lord,&rdquo; counsel for the Crown responded
      demurely. &ldquo;It was your lordship&rsquo;s convenience we all had at
      heart, rather than the prisoner&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; the judge said sharply, with a
      suspicious frown. Then he recovered himself with a start. For a moment he
      had half fancied that fellow, Forbes-Ewing, meant SOMETHING by what he
      said&mdash;meant to poke innuendoes at him. But, after all, it was a mere
      polite form. How frightened we all are, to be sure, when we know we&rsquo;re
      on our trial!
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening formalities were soon got over, and then, amid a deep hush of
      breathless lips, Guy Waring, of Staple Inn, Holborn, gentleman, was put
      upon his trial for the wilful murder of Montague Nevitt, eighteen months
      before, at Mambury in Devon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy, standing in the dock, looked puzzled and distracted rather than
      alarmed or terrified. His cheek was pale, to be sure, and his eyes were
      weary; but as Elma glanced from him hastily to the judge on the bench she
      had no hesitation in settling in her own mind which of the two looked most
      at that moment like a detected murderer before the faces of his accusers.
      Guy was calm and self-contained. Sir Gilbert&rsquo;s mute agony was
      terrible to behold. Yet, strange to say, no one else in court save Elma
      seemed to note it as she did. People saw the judge was ill, but that was
      all. Perhaps his wig and robes helped to hide the effect of conscious
      guilt&mdash;nobody suspects a judge of murder; perhaps all eyes were more
      intent on the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it might, counsel for the Crown opened with a statement of what
      they meant to prove, set forth in the familiar forensic fashion. They didn&rsquo;t
      pretend the evidence against the accused was absolutely conclusive or
      overwhelming in character. It was inferential only, but not circumstantial&mdash;inferential
      in such a cumulative and convincing way as could leave no moral doubt on
      any intelligent mind as to the guilt of the prisoner. They would show that
      a close intimacy had long existed between the prisoner Waring and the
      deceased gentleman, Mr. Montague Nevitt. Witnesses would be called who
      would prove to the court that just before the murder this intimacy, owing
      to circumstances which could not fully be cleared up, had passed suddenly
      into intense enmity and open hatred. The landlord of the inn at Mambury,
      and other persons to be called, would speak to the fact that prisoner had
      followed his victim in hot blood into Devonshire, and had tracked him to
      the retreat where he was passing his holiday alone and incognito&mdash;had
      tracked him with every expression of indignant anger, and had uttered
      plain threats of personal violence towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was that all. It would be shown that on the afternoon of Waring&rsquo;s
      visit to Mambury, Mr. Nevitt, who possessed an intense love of nature in
      her wildest and most romantic moods&mdash;it&rsquo;s always counsel&rsquo;s
      cue, for the prosecution, to set the victim&rsquo;s character in the most
      amiable light, and so win the sympathy of the jury as against the accused&mdash;Mr.
      Nevitt, that close student of natural beauty, had strolled by himself down
      a certain woodland path, known as The Tangle, which led through the
      loneliest and leafiest quarter of Mambury Chase, along the tumbling stream
      described as the Mam-water. Ten minutes after he had passed the gate, a
      material witness would show them, the prisoner Waring presented himself,
      and pointedly asked whether his victim had already gone down the path
      before him. He was told that that was so. Thereupon the prisoner opened
      the gate, and followed excitedly. What happened next no living eye but the
      prisoner&rsquo;s ever saw. Montague Nevitt was not destined to issue from
      that wood alive. Two days later his breathless body was found, all stiff
      and stark, hidden among the brown bracken at the bottom of the dell, where
      the murderer no doubt had thrust it away out of his sight on that fatal
      afternoon in fear and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way through the opening speech Sir Gilbert&rsquo;s heart beat fast
      and hard. He had never heard Forbes-Ewing open a case so well. The man
      would be hanged! He felt sure of it! He could see it! For a while the
      judge almost gloated over that prospect of release. What was Guy&rsquo;s
      life to him now, by the side of his wife&rsquo;s and Gwendoline&rsquo;s
      happiness? But as counsel uttered the words, &ldquo;What happened next no
      living eye but the prisoner&rsquo;s ever saw,&rdquo; he looked hard at
      Guy. Not a quiver of remorse or of guilty knowledge passed over the young
      man&rsquo;s face. But Elma Clifford, for her part, looked at the judge on
      the bench. Their eyes met once more. Again Sir Gilbert&rsquo;s fell. Oh,
      heavens! how terrible! Even for Gwendoline&rsquo;s sake he could never
      stand this appalling suspense. But perhaps after all the prosecution might
      fail. There was still a chance left that the jury might acquit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, torn by conflicting emotions, he sat there still, stiff and motionless
      in his seat as an Egyptian statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then counsel went on to deal in greater detail with the question of
      motive. There were two motives the prosecution proposed to allege: first,
      the known enmity of recent date between the two parties, believed to have
      reference to some business dispute; and, secondly&mdash;here counsel
      dropped his voice to a very low key&mdash;he was sorry to suggest it; but
      the evidence bore it out&mdash;mere vulgar love of gain&mdash;the
      commonplace thirst after filthy lucre. They would bring witnesses to show
      that when Mr. Montague Nevitt was last seen alive, he was in possession of
      a pocket-book containing a very large large sum in Bank of England notes
      of high value; from the moment of his death that pocket-book had
      disappeared, and nobody knew what had since become of it. It was not upon
      the body when the body was found. And all their efforts to trace the
      missing notes, whose numbers were not known, had been unhappily
      unsuccessful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy listened to all this impeachment in a dazed, dreamy way. He hardly
      knew what it meant. It appalled and chilled him. The web of circumstances
      was too thick for him to break. He couldn&rsquo;t understand it himself.
      And what was far worse, he could give no active assistance to his own
      lawyers on the question of the notes&mdash;which might be very important
      evidence against him&mdash;without further prejudicing his case by
      confessing the forgery. At all hazards, he was determined to keep that
      quiet now. Cyril had never spoken to a soul of that episode, and to speak
      of it, as things stood, would have been certain death to him. I would be
      to supply the one missing link of motive which the prosecution needed to
      complete their chain of cumulative evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some comfort to him to think, however, that the secret was safe in
      Cyril&rsquo;s keeping. Cyril had all the remaining notes, still unchanged,
      in his possession; and the prosecution, knowing nothing of the forgery, or
      its sequel, had no clue at all as to where they came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as for Sir Gilbert, he listened still with ever-deepening horror. His
      mind swayed to and fro between hope and remorse. They were making the man
      guilty, and Gwendoline would be saved! They were making the man guilty,
      and a gross wrong would be perpetrated! Great drops of sweat stood colder
      than ever on his burning brow. He couldn&rsquo;t have believed
      Forbes-Ewing could have done it so well. He was weaving a close web round
      an innocent man with consummate forensic skill and cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case went on to its second stage. Witnesses were called, and Guy
      listened to them dreamily. All of them bore out counsel&rsquo;s opening
      statement. Every man in court felt the evidence was going very hard
      against the prisoner. They&rsquo;d caught the right man, that was clear&mdash;so
      the spectators opined. They&rsquo;d proved it to the hilt. This fellow
      would swing for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the landlord of the Talbot Arms at Mambury shuffled slowly into
      the witness-box. He was a heavy, dull man, and he gave evidence as to
      Nevitt&rsquo;s stay under an assumed name&mdash;which counsel explained
      suggestively by the deceased gentleman&rsquo;s profound love of retirement&mdash;and
      as to Guy&rsquo;s angry remarks and evident indignation. But the most
      sensational part of all his evidence was that which related to the
      pocket-book Montague Nevitt was carrying at the time of his death,
      containing notes, he should say, for several hundred-pounds, &ldquo;or it
      murt be thousands&mdash;and yet, again, it mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; which had
      totally disappeared since the day of the murder. Diligent search had been
      made for the pocket-book everywhere by the landlord and the police, but it
      had vanished into space, &ldquo;leaving not a wrack behind,&rdquo; as
      junior counsel for the prosecution poetically phrased it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the words Cyril mechanically dived his hand into his pocket, as he had
      done a hundred times a day before, during these last eighteen months, to
      assure himself that that most incriminating and unwelcome object was still
      safely ensconced in its usual resting-place. Yes, there it was sure
      enough, as snug as ever! He sighed, and pulled his hand out again
      nervously, with a little jerk. Something came with it, that fell on the
      floor with a jingle by his neighbour&rsquo;s feet. Cyril turned crimson,
      then deadly pale. He snatched at the object; but his neighbour picked it
      up and examined it cursorily. Its flap had burst open with the force of
      the fall, and on the inside the finder read with astonishment, in very
      plain letters, the very name of the murdered man, &ldquo;Montague Nevitt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyril held out his hand to recover it impatiently. But the finder was too
      much taken back at his strange discovery to part with it so readily. It
      was full of money-Bank of England notes; and through the transparent paper
      of the outermost among them the finder could dimly read the words, &ldquo;One
      hundred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose in his place, and held the pocket-book aloft in his hand with a
      triumphant gesture. Cyril tried in vain to clutch at it. The witness
      turned round sharply, disturbed by this incident. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      that?&rdquo; the judge exclaimed, puckering his brows in disapprobation,
      and looking angrily towards the disturber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, my lord,&rdquo; the innkeeper answered, letting his
      jaw drop slowly in almost speechless amazement, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the
      thing I was a-talking of: that&rsquo;s Mr. Nevitt&rsquo;s pocket-book.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand it up,&rdquo; the judge said shortly, gazing hard with all his
      eyes at the mute evidence so tendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The finder handed it up without note or comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Gilbert turned the book over in blank surprise. He was dumfoundered
      himself. For a minute or two he examined it carefully, inside and out.
      Yes; there was no mistake. It was really what they called it. &ldquo;Montague
      Nevitt&rdquo; was written in plain letters on the leather flap; within lay
      half-a-dozen engraved visiting-cards, a Foreign Office passport in Nevitt&rsquo;s
      name, and thirty Bank of England notes for one hundred pounds apiece. This
      was, indeed, a mystery!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did it come from?&rdquo; the judge asked, drawing a painfully
      deep breath, and handing it across to the jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the finder answered, &ldquo;If you please, my lord, the gentleman next
      to me pulled it out of his pocket.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; the judge inquired, with a sinking heart, for he
      himself knew perfectly well who was the unhappy possessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a thrill of horror ran round the crowded court as Forbes-Ewing
      answered, in a very distinct voice, &ldquo;Mr. Cyril Waring, my lord, the
      brother of the prisoner.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIII. &mdash; SIR GILBERT&rsquo;S TEMPTATION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cyril felt all was up. Elma glanced at him trembling. This was horrible,
      inconceivable, inexplicable, fatal. The very stars in their courses seem
      to fight against Guy. Blind chance checkmated them. No hope was left now,
      save in Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s own sense of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve sat there, transfixed with horror. No
      answering gleam now shot through his dull, glazed eye. For he alone knew
      that whatever made the case against the prisoner look worse, made his own
      position each moment more awful and more intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the rest of the case, Cyril sat in his place like a stone figure.
      Counsel for the Crown generously abstained from putting him into the
      witness-box to give testimony against his brother. Or rather, they thought
      the facts themselves, as they had just come out in court, more telling for
      the jury than any formal evidence. The only other witness of importance
      was, therefore, the lad who had sat on the gate by the entrance to The
      Tangle. As he scrambled into the box Sir Gilbert&rsquo;s anxiety grew
      visibly deeper and more acute than ever. For the boy was the one person
      who had seen him at Mambury on the day of the murder; and on the boy
      depended his sole chance of being recognised. At Tavistock, eighteen
      months before, Sir Gilbert had left the cross-examination of this witness
      in the hands of a junior, and the boy hadn&rsquo;t noticed him, sitting
      down among the Bar with gown and wig on. But to-day, it was impossible the
      boy shouldn&rsquo;t see him; and if the boy should recognise him&mdash;why,
      then, Heaven help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad gave his evidence-in-chief with great care and deliberateness. He
      swore positively to Guy, and wasn&rsquo;t for a moment to be shaken in
      cross-examination. He admitted he had been mistaken at Tavistock, and
      confused the prisoner with Cyril&mdash;when he saw one of them apart&mdash;but
      now that he saw &lsquo;em both together before his eyes at once, why, he
      could take his solemn oath as sure as fate upon him. Guy&rsquo;s counsel
      failed utterly to elicit anything of importance, except&mdash;and here Sir
      Gilbert&rsquo;s face grew whiter than ever&mdash;except that another
      gentleman whom the lad didn&rsquo;t know had asked at the gate about the
      path, and gone round the other way as if to meet Mr. Nevitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a gentleman?&rdquo; the cross-examiner inquired,
      clutching at this last straw as a mere chance diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a vurry big zart o&rsquo; a gentleman,&rdquo; witness
      answered, unabashed. &ldquo;A vine vigger o&rsquo; a man. Jest such
      another as thik &lsquo;un with the wig ther.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he stared hard at the judge, a good scrutinizing stare. Sir
      Gilbert quailed, and glanced instinctively, first at the boy, and then at
      Elma. Not a spark of intelligence shone in the lad&rsquo;s stolid eyes.
      But Elma&rsquo;s were fixed upon him with a serpentine glare of awful
      fascination. &ldquo;Thou art the man,&rdquo; they seemed to say to him
      mutely. Sir Gilbert, in his awe, was afraid to look at them. They made him
      wild with terror, yet they somehow fixed him. Try as he would to keep his
      own from meeting them, they attracted him irresistibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ripple, of faint laughter ran lightly through the court at the
      undisguised frankness of the boy&rsquo;s reply. The judge repressed it
      sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he was just such another one as his lordship, was he?&rdquo;
      counsel repeated, pressing the lad hard. &ldquo;Now, are you quite sure
      you remember all the people you saw that day? Are you quite sure the other
      man who asked about passers-by wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;for example&mdash;the
      judge himself who&rsquo;s sitting here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Gilbert glanced up with a quick, suspicious air. It was only a shot at
      random&mdash;the common advocate&rsquo;s trick in trying to confuse a
      witness over questions of identity; but to Sir Gilbert, under the
      circumstances, it was inexpressibly distressing. &ldquo;Well, it murt ‘a
      been he,&rdquo; the lad answered, putting his head on one side, and
      surveying the judge closely with prolonged attention. &ldquo;Thik un
      &lsquo;ad just such another pair o&rsquo; &lsquo;ands as his lordship do
      &lsquo;ave. It murt ‘a been his lordship &lsquo;urself as is zitting
      there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This goes quite beyond the bounds of decency,&rdquo; Sir Gilbert
      murmured faintly, with a vain endeavour to hold his hands on the desk in
      an unconcerned attitude. &ldquo;Have the kindness, Mr. Walters, to spare
      the Bench. Attend to your examination. Observations of that sort are
      wholly uncalled for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boy, once started, was not so easily repressed. &ldquo;Why, it was
      his lordship,&rdquo; he went on, scanning the judge still harder. &ldquo;I
      do mind his vurry voice. It was &lsquo;im, no doubt about it. I&rsquo;ve
      zeed a zight o&rsquo; people, since I zeed &lsquo;im that day, but I do
      mind his voice, and I do mind his &lsquo;ands, and I do mind his ve-ace
      the zame as if it wur yesterday. Now I come to look, blessed if it wasn&rsquo;t
      his lordship!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy&rsquo;s counsel smiled a triumphant smile. He had carried his point.
      He had confused the witness. This showed how little reliance could be
      placed upon the boy&rsquo;s evidence as to personal identity! He&rsquo;d
      identify anybody who happened to be suggested to him! But Sir Gilbert&rsquo;s
      face grew yet more deadly pale. For he saw at a glance this was no
      accident or mistake; the boy really remembered him! And Elma&rsquo;s
      steadfast eyes looked him through and through, with that irresistible
      appeal, still more earnestly than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Gilbert breathed again. He had been recognised to no purpose. Even
      this positive identification fell flat upon everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the examination and cross-examination were finished, and Guy&rsquo;s
      counsel began his hopeless task of unravelling this tangled mass of
      suggestion and coincidence. He had no witnesses to call; the very nature
      of the case precluded that. All he could do was to cavil over details, to
      point out possible alternatives, to lay stress upon the absence of direct
      evidence, and to ask that the jury should give the prisoner the benefit of
      the doubt, if any doubt at all existed in their minds as to his guilt or
      innocence. Counsel had meant when he first undertook the case to lay great
      stress also on the presumed absence of motive; but, after the fatal
      accident which resulted in the disclosure of Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s
      pocket-book, any argument on that score would have been worse than
      useless. Counsel elected rather to pass the episode by in discreet
      silence, and to risk everything on the uncertainty of the actual
      encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he sat down, wiping his brow in despair, after what he felt
      himself to be a most feeble performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Sir Gilbert began, and in a very tremulous and failing voice summed
      briefly up the whole of the evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men who remember Gildersleeve&rsquo;s old blustering manner stood aghast
      at the timidity with which the famous lawyer delivered himself on this,
      the first capital charge ever brought before him. He reminded the jury, in
      very solemn and almost warning tones, that where a human life was at
      stake, mere presumptive evidence should always carry very little weight
      with it. And the evidence here was all purely presumptive. The prosecution
      had shown nothing more than a physical possibility that the prisoner at
      the bar might have committed the murder. There was evidence of animus, it
      was true; but that evidence was weak; there was partial identification;
      but that identification lay open to the serious objection that all the
      persons who now swore to Guy Waring&rsquo;s personality had sworn just as
      surely and confidently before to his brother Cyril&rsquo;s. On the whole,
      the judge summed up strongly in Guy&rsquo;s favour. He wiped his clammy
      brow and looked appealingly at the bar. As the jury would hope for justice
      themselves, let them remember to mete out nothing but strict justice to
      the accused person who now stood trembling in the dock before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the court stood astonished. Could this be Gildersleeve? Atkins would
      never have summed up like that. Atkins would have gone in point-blank for
      hanging him. And everybody thought Gildersleeve would hang with the best.
      Nobody had suspected him till then of any womanly weakness about capital
      punishment. There was a solemn hush as the judge ended. Then everybody saw
      the unhappy man was seriously ill. Great streams of sweat trickled slowly
      down his brow. His eyes stared in front of him. His mouth twitched
      horribly. He looked like a person on the point of apoplexy. The prisoner
      at the bar gazed hard at him and pitied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dying himself, and he wants to go out with a clear
      conscience at last,&rdquo; some one suggested in a low voice at the
      barristers&rsquo; table. The explanation served. It was whispered round
      the court in a hushed undertone that the judge to-day was on his very last
      legs, and had summed up accordingly. Late in life, he had learned to show
      mercy, as he hoped for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a deadly pause. The jury retired to consider their verdict. Two
      men remained behind in court, waiting breathless for their return. Two
      lives hung at issue in the balance while the jury deliberated. Elma
      Clifford, glancing with a terrified eye from one to the other, could
      hardly help pitying the guiltiest most. His look of mute suffering was so
      inexpressibly pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twelve good men and true were gone for a full half-hour. Why, nobody
      knew. The case was as plain as a pikestaff, gossipers said in court. If he
      had been caught red-handed, he&rsquo;d have been hanged without remorse.
      It was only the eighteen months and the South African episode that could
      make the jury hesitate for one moment about hanging him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, a sound, a thrill, a movement by the door. Every eye was strained
      forward. The jury trooped back again. They took their places in silence.
      Sir Gilbert scanned their faces with an agonized look. It was a moment of
      ghastly and painful suspense. He was waiting for their verdict&mdash;on
      himself, and Guy Waring.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV. &mdash; AT BAY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Only two people in court doubted for one moment what the verdict would be.
      And those two were the pair who stood there on their trial. Sir Gilbert
      couldn&rsquo;t believe the jury would convict an innocent man of the crime
      he himself had half unwittingly committed. Guy Waring couldn&rsquo;t
      believe the jury would convict an innocent man of the crime he had never
      been guilty of. So those two doubted. To all the rest the verdict was a
      foregone conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, dead silence reigned everywhere in the court as the clerk of
      arraigns put the solemn question, &ldquo;Gentlemen, do you find the
      prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the foreman, clearing his throat huskily, answered in a very tremulous
      tone, &ldquo;We find him guilty of wilful murder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long, deep pause. Every one looked at the prisoner. Guy Waring
      stood like one stunned by the immensity of the blow. It was an awful
      moment. He knew he was innocent; but he knew now the English law would
      hang him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One pair of eyes in the court, however, was not fixed on Guy. Elma
      Clifford, at that final and supreme moment, gazed hard with all her soul
      at Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve. Her glance went through him. She sat like an
      embodied conscience before him. The judge rose slowly, his eyes riveted on
      hers. He was trembling with remorse, and deadlier pale than ever. An awful
      lividness stole over his face. His lips were contorted. His eyebrows
      quivered horribly. Still gazing straight at Elma, he essayed to speak.
      Twice he opened his parched lips. Then his voice failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot accept that finding,&rdquo; he said at last, in a very
      solemn tone, battling hard for speech against some internal enemy. &ldquo;I
      cannot accept it. Clerk, you will enter a verdict of not guilty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep hum of surprise ran round the expectant court. Every mouth opened
      wide, and drew a long hushed breath. Senior counsel for the Crown jumped
      to his feet astonished. &ldquo;But why, my lord?&rdquo; he asked tartly,
      thus baulked of his success. &ldquo;On what ground does your lordship
      decide to override the plain verdict of the jury?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The pause that followed was inexpressibly terrible. Guy Waring waited for
      the answer in an agony of suspense. He knew what it meant now. With a rush
      it all occurred to him. He knew who was the murderer. But he hoped for
      nothing. Sir Gilbert faltered: Elma Clifford&rsquo;s eyes were upon him
      still, compelling him. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said at last, with a
      still more evident and physical effort, pumping the words out slowly,
      &ldquo;I am here to administer justice, and justice I will administer....
      This man is innocent. It was I myself who killed Montague Nevitt that day
      at Mambury.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At those awful words, uttered in a tone so solemn that no one could doubt
      either their truth or their sincerity, a cold thrill ran responsive
      through the packed crowd of auditors. The silence was profound. In its
      midst, a boy&rsquo;s voice burst forth all at once, directed, as it
      seemed, to the counsel for the Crown, &ldquo;I said it was him,&rdquo; the
      voice cried, in a triumphant tone. &ldquo;I knowed &lsquo;um! I knowed
      &lsquo;um! Thik there&rsquo;s the man that axed me the way down the dell
      the marnin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the murder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge turned towards the boy with a ghastly smile of enforced
      recognition. &ldquo;You say the truth, my lad,&rdquo; he answered, without
      any attempt at concealment. &ldquo;It was I who asked you. It was I who
      killed him. I went round by the far gate after hearing he was there, and,
      cutting across the wood, I met Montague Nevitt in the path by The Tangle.
      I went there to meet him; I went there to confront him; but not of malice
      prepense to murder him. I wanted to question him about a family matter.
      Why I needed to question him no one henceforth shall ever know. That
      secret, thank Heaven, rests now in Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s grave. But when
      I did question him, he answered me back with so foul an aspersion upon a
      lady who was very near and dear to me&rdquo;&mdash;the judge paused a
      moment; he was fighting hard for breath; something within was evidently
      choking him. Then he went on more excitedly&mdash;&ldquo;an aspersion upon
      a lady whom I love more than life&mdash;an insult that no man could stand&mdash;an
      unspeakable foulness; and I sprang at him, the cur, in the white heat of
      my anger, not meaning or dreaming to hurt him seriously. I caught him by
      the throat.&rdquo; The judge held up his hands before the whole court
      appealingly. &ldquo;Look at those hands, gentlemen,&rdquo; he cried,
      turning them about. &ldquo;How could I ever know how hard and how strong
      they were? I only seemed to touch him. I just pushed him from my path. He
      fell at once at my feet&mdash;dead, dead unexpectedly. Remember how it all
      came about. The medical evidence showed his heart was weak, and he died in
      the scuffle. How was I to know all that? I only knew this&mdash;he fell
      dead before me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a face of speechless awe, he paused and wiped his brow. Not a soul in
      court moved or breathed above a whisper. It was evident the judge was in a
      paroxysm of contrition. His face was drawn up. His whole frame quivered
      visibly. Even Elma pitied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I did a grievous wrong,&rdquo; the judge continued once
      more, his voice now very thick and growing rapidly thicker. &ldquo;I did a
      grievous wrong, for which here to-day, before all this court, I humbly ask
      Guy Waring&rsquo;s pardon. I had killed Montague Nevitt, unintentionally,
      unwittingly, accidentally almost, in a moment of anger, never knowing I
      was killing him. And if he had been a stronger or a healthier man, what
      little I did to him would never have killed him. I didn&rsquo;t mean to
      murder him. For that my remorse is far less poignant. But what I did after
      was far worse than the murder. I behaved like a sneak&mdash;I behaved like
      a coward. I saw suspicion was aroused against the prisoner, Guy Waring.
      And what did I do then? Instead of coming forward like a man, as I ought,
      and saying &lsquo;I did it,&rsquo; and standing my trial on the charge of
      manslaughter, I did my best to throw further suspicion on an innocent
      person. I made the case look blacker and worse for Guy Waring. I don&rsquo;t
      condone my own crime. I did it for my wife&rsquo;s sake and my daughter&rsquo;s,
      I admit&mdash;but I regret it now bitterly&mdash;and am I not atoning for
      it? With a great humiliation, am I not amply atoning for it? I wrote an
      unsigned letter warning Waring at once to fly the country, as a warrant
      was out against him. Waring foolishly took my advice, and fled forthwith.
      From that day to this&rdquo;&mdash;he gazed round him appealingly&mdash;&ldquo;oh,
      friends, I have never known one happy moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy gazed at him from the dock, where he still stood guarded by two strong
      policemen, and felt a fresh light break suddenly in upon him. Their
      positions now were almost reversed. It was he who was the accuser, and Sir
      Gilbert Gildersleeve, the judge in that court, who stood charged to-day on
      his own confession with causing the death of Montague Nevitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was YOU&rdquo; Guy said slowly, breaking the pause at last,
      &ldquo;who sent me that anonymous letter at Plymouth?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I,&rdquo; the judge answered, in an almost inaudible,
      gurgling tone. &ldquo;It was I who so wronged you. Can you ever forgive me
      for it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Guy gazed at him fixedly. He himself had suffered much. Cyril and Elma had
      suffered still more. But the judge, he felt sure, had suffered most of all
      of them. In this moment of relief, this moment of vindication, this moment
      of triumph, he could afford to be generous. &ldquo;Sir Gilbert
      Gildersleeve, I forgive you,&rdquo; he answered slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge gazed around him with a vacant stare. &ldquo;I feel cold,&rdquo;
      he said, shivering; &ldquo;very cold, very faint, too. But I&rsquo;ve made
      all right HERE,&rdquo; and he held out a document. &ldquo;I wrote this
      paper in my room last night&mdash;in case of accident&mdash;confessing
      everything. I brought it down here, signed and witnessed, unread,
      intending to read it out if the verdict went against me&mdash;I mean,
      against Waring.... But I feel too weak now to read anything further.... I&rsquo;m
      so cold, so cold. Take the paper, Forbes-Ewing. It&rsquo;s all in your
      line. You&rsquo;ll know what to do with it.&rdquo; He could hardly utter a
      word, breath failed him so fast. &ldquo;This thing has killed me,&rdquo;
      he went on, mumbling. &ldquo;I deserved it. I deserved it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the prisoner?&rdquo; the authority from the gaol asked,
      as the judge collapsed rather than sat down on the bench again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those words roused Sir Gilbert to full consciousness once more. The judge
      rose again, solemnly, in all the majesty of his ermine. &ldquo;The
      prisoner is discharged,&rdquo; he said, in a loud, clear voice. &ldquo;I
      am here to do justice&mdash;justice against myself. I enter a verdict of
      not guilty.&rdquo; Then he turned to the polices &ldquo;I am your
      prisoner,&rdquo; he went on, in a broken, rambling way. &ldquo;I give
      myself in charge for the manslaughter of Montague Nevitt. Manslaughter,
      not murder. Though I don&rsquo;t even admit myself, indeed, it was
      anything more than justifiable homicide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank back again once more, and murmured three times in his seat, as if
      to himself, &ldquo;Justifiable homicide! Justifiable homicide! Just&mdash;ifiable
      homicide!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody rose in court as he sank, and moved quickly towards him. The
      judge recognised him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Granville Kelmscott,&rdquo; he said; in a weary voice, &ldquo;help
      me out of this. I am very, very ill. You&rsquo;re a friend. I&rsquo;m
      dying. Give me your arm! Assist me!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV. &mdash; ALL&rsquo;S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Granville helped him on his arm into the judge&rsquo;s room amid profound
      silence. All the court was deeply stirred. A few personal friends hurried
      after him eagerly. Among them were the Warings, and Mrs. Clifford, and
      Elma.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge staggered to a seat, and held Granville&rsquo;s hand long and
      silently in his. Then his eye caught Elma&rsquo;s. He turned to her
      gratefully. &ldquo;Thank you, young lady,&rdquo; he said, in a very thick
      voice. &ldquo;You were extremely good. I forget your name. But you helped
      me greatly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was such a pathetic ring in those significant words, &ldquo;I forget
      your name,&rdquo; that every eye about stood dimmed with moisture. Remorse
      had clearly blotted out all else now from Sir Gilbert Gildersleeve&rsquo;s
      powerful brain save the solitary memory of his great wrong-doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s upon his mind still,&rdquo; Elma cried, looking
      hard at him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dying! he&rsquo;s dying! But he wants to
      say something else before he dies, I&rsquo;m certain. ... Mr. Kelmscott,
      it&rsquo;s to you. Oh, Cyril, stand back! Mother, leave them alone! I&rsquo;m
      sure from his eye he wants to say something to Mr. Kelmscott.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They all fell back reverently. They stood in the presence of death and of
      a mighty sorrow. Sir Gilbert still held Granville&rsquo;s hand fast bound
      in his own. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll kill her,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
      kill her! I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll kill her! She&rsquo;ll never get over
      the thought that her father was&mdash;was the cause of Montague Nevitt&rsquo;s
      death. And you&rsquo;ll never care to marry a girl of whom people will
      say, either justly or unjustly, &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a murderers daughter&rsquo;....
      And that will kill her, too. For, Kelmscott, she loved you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granville held the dying man&rsquo;s hand still more gently than ever.
      &ldquo;Sir Gilbert,&rdquo; he said, leaning over him with very tender
      eyes, &ldquo;no event on earth could ever possibly alter Gwendoline&rsquo;s
      love for me, or my love for Gwendoline. I know you can&rsquo;t live. This
      shock has been too much for you. But if it will make you die any the
      happier now to know that Gwendoline and I will still be one, I give you my
      sacred promise at this solemn moment, that as soon as she likes I will
      marry Gwendoline.&rdquo; He paused for a second. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      understand all this story just yet,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;But of one
      thing I&rsquo;m certain. The sympathy of every soul in court to-day went
      with you as you spoke out the truth so manfully. The sympathy of all
      England will go with you to-morrow when they come to learn of it.... Sir
      Gilbert, till this morning I never admired you, much as I love Gwendoline.
      As you made that confession just now in court, I declare, I admired you.
      With all the greater confidence now will I marry your daughter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They carried him to the judge&rsquo;s lodgings in the town, and laid him
      there peaceably for the doctors to tend him. For a fortnight the shadow of
      Gildersleeve still lingered on, growing feebler and feebler in intellect
      every day. But the end was certain. It was softening of the brain, and it
      proceeded rapidly. The horror of that unspeakable trial had wholly
      unnerved him. The great, strong man cried and sobbed like a baby. Lady
      Gildersleeve and Gwendoline were with him all through. He seldom spoke.
      When he did, it was generally to murmur those fixed words of exculpation,
      in a tremulous undertone, &ldquo;It was my hands that did it&mdash;these
      great, clumsy hands of mine&mdash;not I&mdash;not I. I never, never meant
      it. It was an accident. An accident. Justifiable homicide.... What I
      really regret is for that poor fellow Waring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the end of a fortnight he died, once smiling, with Gwendoline&rsquo;s
      hand locked tight in his own, and Granville Kelmscott kneeling in tears by
      his bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kelmscott property was settled by arrangement. It never came into
      court. With the aid of the family lawyers the three half-brothers divided
      it amicably. Guy wouldn&rsquo;t hear of Granville&rsquo;s giving up his
      claim to the house and park at Tilgate. Granville was to the manner born,
      he said, and brought up to expect it; while Cyril and he, mere waifs and
      strays in the world, would be much better off, even so, with their third
      of the property each, than they ever before in their lives could have
      counted upon. As for Cyril, he was too happy in Guy&rsquo;s exculpation
      from the greater crime, and his frank explanation of the lesser&mdash;under
      Nevitt&rsquo;s influence&mdash;to care very much in his own heart what
      became of Tilgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only one man who objected to this arrangement was Mr. Reginald
      Clifford, C.M.G., of Craighton. The Companion of the Militant Saints was
      strongly of opinion that Cyril Waring oughtn&rsquo;t to have given up his
      prior claim to the family mansion, even for valuable consideration
      elsewhere. Mr. Clifford drew himself up to the full height of his spare
      figure, and caught in the tight skin of his mummy-like face rather tighter
      than before, as he delivered himself of this profound opinion. &ldquo;A
      man should consult his own dignity,&rdquo; he said stiffly, and with great
      precision; &ldquo;if he&rsquo;s born to assume a position in the county,
      he should assume that position as a sacred duty. He should remember that
      his wife and children&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he hasn&rsquo;t got any wife, papa,&rdquo; Elma ventured to
      interpose, with a bright little smile; &ldquo;so THAT can&rsquo;t count
      either way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t a wife AT PRESENT, to be sure; that&rsquo;s
      perfectly true, my dear; no wife AT PRESENT; but he will probably now, in
      his existing circumstances, soon obtain one. A Man of Property should
      always marry. Mr. Waring will naturally desire to ally himself to some
      family of Good Position in the county; and the lady&rsquo;s relations
      would, of course, insist&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter to us, papa,&rdquo; Elma answered
      maliciously; &ldquo;for, as far as we&rsquo;re concerned, you know; you&rsquo;ve
      often said that nothing on earth would ever induce you to give your
      consent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Gentleman of Good Position in the county gazed at his daughter aghast
      with horror. &ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he said, with positive alarm,
      &ldquo;your remarks are nothing short of Revolutionary. You must remember
      that since then circumstances have altered. At that time, Mr. Waring was a
      painter&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a painter still, I believe,&rdquo; Elma put in,
      parenthetically. &ldquo;The acquisition of property or county rank doesn&rsquo;t
      seem to have had the very slightest effect one way or the other upon his
      drawing or his colouring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father disdained to take notice of such flippant remarks. &ldquo;At
      that time,&rdquo; he repeated solemnly, &ldquo;Mr. Waring was a painter, a
      mere ordinary painter; we know him now to be the heir and representative
      of a great County Family. If he were to ask you to-day&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he did ask me a long time ago, you know, papa,&rdquo; Elma put
      in demurely. &ldquo;And at that time, you remember, you objected to the
      match; so of course, as in duty bound, I at once refused him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did your father say to that, Elma?&rdquo; Cyril asked,
      with a smile, as she narrated the whole circumstances to him some hours
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he only said, &lsquo;But he&rsquo;ll ask you again now, you may
      be sure, my child.&rsquo; And I replied very gravely, I didn&rsquo;t think
      you would. And do you know, Cyril, I really don&rsquo;t think you will,
      either.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, Elma?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, you foolish boy, it isn&rsquo;t the least bit in the world
      necessary. This has been, all through, a comedy of errors. Tragedy enough
      intermixed; but still a comedy of errors. There never was really any
      reason on earth why either of us shouldn&rsquo;t have married the other.
      And the only thing I now regret myself is that I didn&rsquo;t do as I
      first threatened, and marry you outright, just to show my confidence in
      you and Guy, at the time when everybody else had turned most against you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose we make up for lost time now by saying Wednesday
      fortnight,&rdquo; Cyril suggested, after a short pause, during which both
      of them simultaneously had been otherwise occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cyril, that&rsquo;s awfully quick! It could hardly be managed.
      There&rsquo;s the dresses, and all that! And the bridesmaids to arrange
      about! And the invitations to issue!... But still, sooner than put you off
      any longer now&mdash;well, yes, my dear boy&mdash;I dare say we could make
      it Wednesday fortnight.&rdquo;

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
